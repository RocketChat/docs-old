# Photos

Our brand makes use of illustrations in lieu of photography. Although images of people should be included in these illustrations for both realism and relatability, the focal point should be the product and not the photography, hence the shift in focus favoring illustration.

We increasingly want to appropriate a unique, contemporary language that conveys our value proposition in the stories that we are telling. So, we have some guidelines to inspire the way the Rocket.Chat style must be.

### Treatment

Our photos are high temperature and saturated, resulting in a simple, proprietary effect.

### Image Bank

First of all, when choosing a bank image photo, it is necessary to understand the content and context that it will bring to your art. Then you will do the right search and filter for the best image. The more specific your search term is, the easier it will be to find the right image.
