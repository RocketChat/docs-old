Click open your Salesforce CRM app to see the settings available to you as an administrator under the **Settings** tab.

Following are the settings available:

1. **Consumer Key** is available inside your Salesforce instance.
2. **Private Key** is also available inside your Salesforce instance.
3. **Salesforce Username**: This is the salesforce username used here for identification.
4. **Display Contact information when assigning the agent to the chat**: If enabled, Salesforce contact information will be displayed to agents when they are assigned to chats.
5. **Auto-Save/Update Contacts when a Chat Ends**: If enabled, the app will auto-save/update the visitor info on Salesforce once an agent closes the chat.
6. **Metadata Refresh Interval(in Minutes)**: For better user experience, the app will cache some meta-data information from Salesforce. This setting defines the duration within which the app will automatically refresh its cache
7. **Salesforce Session Timeout(in Minutes)**: This should be the same as Session Timeout setting on your Salesforce Setting ( Setup --> Session Settings --> Session Timeout --> Timeout Value )
8. Hit **Save.**
