# Edit your Email Content

Almost all predefined emails sent to users in your Rocket.Chat server can be customized.

To customize email content, simply select the email you want to change, and set the `Custom` option to `true`.

From there you can change the subject and the body of an email. When you write the body of your email, you can add _placeholders_ that change to real data when you send it. E.g. `[Site_Name]` changes to your Rocket.Chat server name.

Your access to more _placeholders_ depends on which email you are editing. For a detailed list of available _placeholders_, check the text under the `Body` field.
