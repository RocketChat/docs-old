# Registering an account

To access any Rocket.Chat server, register an account manually or by using one of the many supported OAuth services (if the desired server has enabled these services). After successfully registering, you can [log in](../login/) to the server.

## Manual registration

You can create an account by providing your:

- Name
- Email
- Password

A server can ask for you to verify your email, this can be done by simply clicking on the link sent to the registered email.

Servers can be configured to use custom parameters. Therefore each Rocket.Chat server might ask for different information or restrict registration based on the rules set by the server. If you are unsure how to register, please contact your server administrator.

## OAuth registration

If your server has configured OAuth services (i.e. GitHub or Google), use the account credentials for that supported service to register into the server.

## Choosing a username and display name

After you have successfully registered, you will be asked to choose your username. Your username is your unique identifier for others to use to direct message or mention you. Your username is separate to your display name on the server.

Usernames on each Rocket.Chat server must be unique to that server. However, display names can repeat on the same server. For example, there can be only one user with the username `johnsmith` but there can be more than one user with the display name `John Smith`.
