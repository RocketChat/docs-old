# Managing your account

To access and manage your Rocket.Chat account on a server, login and **click** on your **profile picture** or **username** and select **My Account**.

Changing an account setting only changes it for the server you are connected to and not all servers you have access to. You will need to configure your account on each server you connect to.

You can manage settings for the following account sections:

Set or change your avatar for a Rocket.Chat server by clicking on one of the images beside your current avatar. To upload a new avatar select the box with an arrow pointing up.

## Security

Enable or disable Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for your account on a Rocket.Chat server.

When you enable Two Factor Authentication you will be required to get a key code from an app on your phone, thus increasing the security when logging in, as seen that your phone will be required to start a session on the selected Rocket.Chat server.

> **Note**: Two Factor Authentication can be turned on and off by the system admin, if you can't find this setting, please contact your system admin.

To enable Two Factor Authentication you need to:

- Click the "Enable two-factor authentication" button.

- Using an authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy or Duo, scan the QR code. It will display a 6 digit code which you need to enter below.

- Copy your backup code somewhere safe if you need to access it in the future without the authentication app. Click "Send" to finish.

- To disable the "Two-factor authentication" simply click on the red button on the same page.
