## Other rights

Other rights for the data subjects are either covered by features already built into our codebase, or outside the scope of the open source software project, including:

### Right to Rectification

The codebase can be configured to support user modification/correction/rectification of any data supplied \(entered\) by the user.

### Right to restriction of processing

This is outside the scope of the open source software project, and is up to the controller \( administrator / deployer / operator of the the server system\) to enforce.

### Right to Object

This is outside the scope of the open source software project, and is up to the controller \( administrator / deployer / operator of the server system\) to enforce.

## Community compliance

The above will allow our community members to build and deploy GDPR compliant systems and services. We know and understand that all of you have custom installation, configuration and deployment environments and that you are working to ensure your own deployment of Rocket.Chat is compliant with GDPR if necessary.

Meanwhile, we would welcome any advice, input, or questions you may have regarding Rocket.Chat’s GDPR readiness. Please help us by emailing your thoughts to gdpr@rocket.chat.
