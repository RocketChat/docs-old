# Developing

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to Rocket.Chat.
If this is the first Open Source project you will contribute to,
we strongly suggest reading GitHub's excellent guide
["Contributing to Open Source"][contributing].

## Getting Started

You can find our projects [here](https://github.com/RocketChat).
Go to the Issues tab and when you find something you would like to work on
just comment on it and we will add an [In Progress label][progress_label].

If you already have a work in progress pull request open for that issue you can simply link that issue on your pull request or write `Closes #ISSUE_NUMBER` where the `ISSUE_NUMBER` is the number in the end of the link url.

**Where to Find Tasks:**

Want a simple task to get you started?
[We maintain a list of those][easy_label]! Or just search for issues tagged contrib:easy

Check our [developer guides](../../developer-guides/)
for more detailed information about pull requests, workflow and API docs.
