# Markdown Style Guide

The Rocket.Chat documentation supports the [Markdown Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) \(You can also find a "Cheatsheet" [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\)

Markdown can be written in various different styles, in this document you will find the standard formatting guide for creating Rocket.Chat documentation.

TODO: We are currently running a markdown [linter](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) on incoming Pull Requests, so it is a good idea to download it and run it locally before submitting a Pull Request.

All the rules listed here have their respective code attached here, so if the linter fails you can come here and check out the rule that was broken.

You can run the Markdown linter locally by installing this [Markdown Linter Tool](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint) and running the command `mdl ../` command on the docs main folder.
