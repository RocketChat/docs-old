## How to apply

Application for Google Summer of Code 2020 is now closed.

#### Update September 8, 2020

The GSoC 2020 season has completed with one of the best experience ever for many of the participating students and mentors.

The final list of successful Google Summer of Code 2020 Rocket.Chat projects and students/mentors is now [officially](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4685162459168768/#5623423331467264) available.

Of the **seven official** GSoC projects, every student has managed to pass their final evaluation.\
Congratulations to all the students of 2020 and their tireless mentors!

Of the **five additional** sponsored projects, **one** student : the problematic one noted in the previous term, has been **failed** by his mentors.

In this final term, we encouraged students to prepare a 30 minutes demo and presentation of their project for our community and core team. Reception was incredible! The list of invitees topped 80! Most presentations were well attended. Students showed off their work proudly alongside their mentors.

For many students, it was the very first presentation experience in their entire life - and having it in front such a supportive audience made it extremely fulfilling. Attendees are delighted to discover the excellent work (and exciting features) that the student undertook.

From the crop of excellent 2020 students, the Rocket.Chat team made an internship offer to one student and he has accepted and became a member of our team. Our long time community contributor, Viasat, has also independently made an offer to another student this year.

#### Update August 4, 2020

Second evaluation has completed. Once again, all mentors have decided to pass their students for this term. Of note is one potentially problematic student, mentor agreed to monitor the situation for the final term. Another student has pre-arranged with his mentor to start the term early and has completed his work by this evaluation.

#### Update July 12, 2020

First evaluation has completed! All students have passed this first term. Most projects have students that are tracking or exceeding planned schedules. There is one project that is slightly lagging and we will keep a watchful eye on it this second term. Progress has been relatively smooth across the projects. Mentors are busy making sure that every student receive his/her evaluation and payment. Students have also completed evaluation for their mentor(s). Some project(s) have decided to start mini virtual daily stand-ups to keep closer tab on progress once past GSoC mid-way mark. Two mentors have withdrawn from participation, one has left the Rocket.Chat organization/community altogether, another due to unanticipated personal obligations.

**Update June 8, 2020**

Coding has started on June 1st. All mentors and students are busy getting the first month milestones of the project under way. Many of them are engaged daily via our [24 x 7 community community server](https://open.rocket.chat)

We have two community sponsored projects with students dropping out during this time, one due to family obligations and another due to prolonged funding uncertainty, and replacement students have been located for these projects.

**Updated June 8, 2020 ; Original on May 5, 2020**

2020 is another exciting year for GSoC at Rocket.Chat. Thanks to the enthusiastic early support from students and community, the program has managed to sustain momentum despite COVID-19 downturn and reduced participation from core. Google has graciously granted us **SEVEN** project slots. As a result, we are delighted to welcome these 7 active community members to work with us during the GSoC 2020 season:

| Student           | Project                                                               | Mentors                                                              |

It was a very difficult decision for us to select _seven_ from the large number of highly qualified students (we were able to engage the students early on in the GSoC cycle with open source contributions via the [GSoC Leaderboard](https://gsoc.rocket.chat) ).

While some high calibre open source contributors were not selected for GSoC; to accommodate these exceptional students, our community member Credit Suisse APAC has agreed to sponsor an additional THREE projects this season.

| Student               | Sponsored Project                                     | Mentors                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Neil Agarwal          | Audio Improvements on mobile apps                     | Nathan Khoo, Diego Mello, Djorkaeff Alexandre  |
| Youssef Muhamad       | Add Analytics to Mobile Apps                          | Noorul Ameen, Diego Mello, Djorkaeff Alexandre |
| Shreyansh Singh Tomar | Content Moderation Rocket.Chat App (Machine Learning) | John Eric Sobrepena, Karan Bedi                |

Furthermore, Viasat, one of Rocket.Chat's long-time community supporters, has agreed to sponsor TWO projects this season.

| Student        | Sponsored Project                  | Mentors                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prajval Raval  | Live agent and chatbot handoff app | David Lassalle, Steve Stetak, Renato Becker, Marcos Defendi |
| Kashish Jayasi | Rocket.Chat mobile site            | Peter Lepeska, Eric Rosenthal, Karan Bedi                   |

This, in combination, allowed us to accommodate a total of **TWELVE** enthusiastic students this summer season.

All students and mentors are now busy mutually bonding and with our core team and greater community. Each mentor is also working with his/her student on refining the weekly and monthly milestones/deliverables within the proposal to better reflect achievable project objectives as well as making them measurable for the monthly evaluations. Meanwhile, all our students are continuing to contribute to the Rocket.Chat open source project(s) as they have been doing since the start of the GSoC 2019 cycle. Many are also engaging with community members on the various public channels of our 24 x 7 [community team server](https://open.rocket.chat).

#### Update March 31st, 2020

First, we would like to thank all GSoC 2020 students for their ethusiastic support for Rocket.Chat. This year we have received a total of **86** proposals, including **81** final proposals. In the final pool, there are 13 proposals that are spam, without content, or not related to our projects.

Over the next month, our mentors will be reviewing the received proposals. Google Summer of Code will be announcing the selected projects and students on May 4th, 2020. Please see [GSoC timeline](google-summer-of-code-2020.md#timeline) for more details.

Meanwhile, we continue to introduce all active and incoming students to open source in general, and Rocket.Chat's ecosystem of open source projects in particular. Students will continue to make meaningful open source contributions in the form of issues & PR for our projects and interact with Rocket.Chat's vibrant community + team.

#### Update March 29th, 2020

Enthusiasm and interest from students are all time high this year; over 112 candidate students have already started to interact with our community and contributing to the repositories! Together, they have already contributed over 100 issues and over 50 merged PRs to our various projects. We are maintaining a real-time updated leaderboard for at-a-glance student (candidates) contribution here:

[https://gsoc.rocket.chat/](https://gsoc.rocket.chat)

The leaderboard project **itself** is open source, created and maintained by our former GSoC student (now mentor and team member). All potential GSoC organizations are welcome to use and deploy it (the project has a super friendly MIT license - just like Rocket.Chat).

[https://github.com/lolimay/GSoC-Contribution-Leaderboard-Node](https://github.com/lolimay/GSoC-Contribution-Leaderboard-Node)

We have recnetly arranged for the TOP 8 student contributors to meet one on one with Rocket.Chat's project lead Gabriel Engel and great remote fun was had by all.

Mentoring interest from core team has been reduced this year, while community mentor participation is at an all time high. Proposals for projects are streaming steadily in since application open, the volume of incoming proposals is reduced compared to prior year - but the percentage of high quality propsals has increased.

The way Bixby focuses on a multimodal approach from the very start could help eliminate the nuances involved in building an intricate voice-only experience.
