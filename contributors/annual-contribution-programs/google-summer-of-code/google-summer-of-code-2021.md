# Google Summer of Code 2021

[![Google Summer of Code 2020](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsoclogo.jpg)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)

### Update August 21, 2021

All 15 of our projects continued smoothly during these final weeks of the GSoC 2021 program. Students and mentors worked hard together to finalize the (now it has become a tradition) [Rocket.Chat GSoC 2021 Project Demos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLee3gqXJQrFXGRepCnOATldI6q-bCsaLB) This is the very first time for some students, to present in front of a group. And the audience this year is up to **120** Rocket.Chat community and team members, as well as fellow GSoC 2021 colleagues and mentors.

This week, students are preparing for their final GSoC submission and final mentor evaluation. Next week, mentors will start their final evaluation.

### Update July 11, 2021

Due to sudden departure of an active mentor, we are in jeopardy of losing two key projects for the year. Thankfully two heroines from Rocket.Chat's own Agile Planning and UI/UX team came forward and, together with mentors from our front-end team, saved the day for these projects. The new mentors assignments are now reflected on these two projects.

| Student      | Project                                                  | Mentors                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Ghulam Ghous | Omnichannel Project: Live Chat Widget - Accessible ModeL | Leticia Peuser, Tasso Evangelista     |
| Dhruv Jain   | Introduce Audio calls to Live Chat                       | Murtaza Patrawala, Gabriel Henriquesz |

The unsung heroine here is Aline Nunes, our senior Agilist, without whose help the last minute mentors re-assignment would not have been possible.

### Update June 25th 2021

\
Community bonding period is now officially over. Coding has officially began on all projects. Students are working towards the July 12 first evaluations.

To accommodate another highly qualified student, and keen interests from mentors, our long time community partner Credit Suisse APAC has sponsored an additional project. This brings our total number of projects this season to **15**.

| Student      | Project                                          | Mentors                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Priya Bihani | Image Manipulation: Editing / Cropping on Upload | Gabriel Henriques, Tasso Evangelista, Vibha Chawla |

### Update May 20th 2021

2021 is an incredible year for GSoC at Rocket.Chat. Thanks to the enthusiastic early support from students and community (mentors), Google has graciously granted us **TWELVE** project slots. The [official listing](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5243748067311616/?sp-page=2) of students selected for these 12 projects is now published.\
\
We are delighted to welcome these 12 active community members to work with us during the GSoC 2021 season:

Even with the generous slot assignment this year, it is still a very difficult decision for many mentors to select from the large number of highly qualified students (we were able to engage the students early on in the GSoC cycle with open source contributions via the [GSoC Leaderboard](https://gsoc.rocket.chat) ; with **219 participating students**, **61 students with contributions**, **21 code committers**, working on **196 Merged PRs**, **231 Open PRs**, and **290 Issues** so far). Several high calibre open source contributors were left out and not selected for GSoC; to accommodate these exceptional students, Rocket.Chat has arranged to sponsor an **additional TWO** projects this season.

| Student        | Sponsored Project                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Sumukha Hegde  | New statuses for user actions/events (Typing 2.0) |
| Deepak Agarwal | Introduce Video calls to Live Chat                |

All verified students are now interacting with their mentors and the greater Rocket.Chat community during the community bonding phase of the 2021 GSoC season.

    **The goal:**

    * Any user can create out-of-office settings in Rocket.Chat by giving from and to date with the auto-reply message.
    * User should be able to select the channels which would receive the out of office notification.
    * The out-of-office notification should only be sent once for the first incoming message.
    * The user can also define his deputy from the list of eligible users.
    * At the time of out of office, the selected deputy will be automatically added to channel and can reply on behalf of main user.
    * After the out-of-office time ends, the deputy should be auto removed from the channel.
* **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with Rocket.Chat, nodeJS, Experience with ReactJS. Must have database skills, ideally MongoDB.

### Ephemeral messages

* **Mentors:** [@kevin.aleman](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/kevin.aleman)
* **Description:** This project aims to create a channel in which the messages sent will vanish after a configured amount of time. This would be a room (channel) setting where you can define how long the messages will last. Messages from here cannot be retrieved after its deletion, and the deletion cannot be deactivated, just postponed.
* **Desirable skills:** Familiarity with JS Full Stack web app development. Experience with MongoDB and PM2 are ideal.

### Voice Channels

* **Mentors**: [@douglas.fabris](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/douglas.fabris), [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen)
* **Description**: The ability to create voice channels would allow users to quickly enter and leave pre-existing voice calls from Rocket.Chat's own UI, enabling a more practical usage of audio features for team collaboration. This project would add the UI elements and integrate them with an established audio platform to handle the calls.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with nodeJS full-stack web app development.

### Decentralized Storage Integration

* **Mentors:** [@murtaza.patrawala](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/murtaza.patrawala)

### Poll App Mega Extensions

* **Mentors:** [@ramkumar.kb](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/ramkumar.kb), [@diego.sampaio](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/diego.sampaio)
*   **Description:** The[ poll app](https://github.com/RocketChat/rocket.chat.app-poll) already allows anyone to create engaging rich interaction polls within any chat room. This project aims to expand its scope and capabilities hugely: making it a tool for enhancing participant's engagement with interactive quizzes/trivia / live-polls.

    Some initial ideas include:

    * Better bar-graph visualization for the responses (with a switch for anonymous responses - so 3 types: Open / Confidential / Mixed)
    * Ability to add user options in the poll response and show the response of those responses in a visual way (e.g., word-cloud)
    * Ability to create different types of polls (e.g., 1-to-5, Agree/Disagree, Overrated/Underrated)
    * Ability to add emoticons on the response options
    * Ability to create `/poll live` or `/live-poll` feature - it has 2 parts (prepare a set of questions beforehand and retrieve it just before the live poll starts. During the live-poll, a countdown timer for each question is shown, and upon completion, the responses are shown visually) a.k.a. multi-question version of the single poll feature
    * (Stretch Goal) Ability to download the `live-poll` response, once the poll is over
    * Enhance[ UIKit](https://docs.rocket.chat/apps-development/uikit) if needed to meet the above goals
* **Desirable Skills:** The sky is _not even the limit_ for this project. We will need a hot-shot all round challenge-loving student already familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, React,[ current poll-app codebase](https://github.com/sampaiodiego/rocket.chat.app-poll) and [Rocket.Chat + Fuselage codebase](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Fuselage).

* **Desirable Skills:** JavaScript / TypeScript
* **Description:** Create internal scripts to extract translation strings from the source code and give some options:
  * Check if all strings are translated in the target languages (en by default)
  * List strings present in the target language that are not in the code anymore
  * Option to render a completion chart for all languages
  * Option to remove strings from all languages based on a target one
  * Option to import missing strings into the target language to easily add translations
  * Integrate the script on CI to block PR from merge if there are new strings without translations

### Introduce Video and Audio calls to Live Chat

* **Mentors**: [@rafaelferreira](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/rafaelferreira), [@murtaza.patrawala](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/murtaza.patrawala)
* **Description:** The outcome expected from this project is to support Video and Audio calls in one of the native Omnichannel entry points called \[Live Chat]\(https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Live Chat). Live Chat is a small and lightweight application designed to provide B2C communication between Agents and website visitors. It is developed with [PreactJS](https://preactjs.com), which means that any ReactJS developer will be able to implement the new features using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) framework.
* **Desirable Skills**: Experience with JavaScript, ReactJS and WebRTC, and WebSocket API.

### **App: Speech-to-Text**

This will allow users to find channels based on: Total number of users, number of messages, search for specific topics, if the channel has been trending lately, and any more ideas we can think of. The whole idea of this project is to improve communities using Rocket.Chat and add a sprinkle of social aspects to Rocket.Chat.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with JavaScript, React, and TypeScript. Knowledge in how to use Rocket.Chat fuselage is a plus.

### Task Channels

* **Mentors**: [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen), [@guilherme.gazzo](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/guilherme.gazzo)
* **Description**: This project aims to create a new kind of channel where instead of sending messages, users would be able to create task cards with several custom fields. Those tasks would then work as a thread header, allowing comments in the format of a thread. The basic additional information for a task message would be an assigned user and a status. The channel header should also list options to filter the tasks by those fields.
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with nodeJS full stack web app development. Experience with ReactJS is ideal.

### Image **Manipulation:** Editing/Cropping on Upload

* **Mentors:** [@gabriel.henriques](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/gabriel.henriques)

### App: Bad-Words Filter

* **Mentors:** [@marcelo.schmidt](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/marcelo.schmidt) and [@douglas.gubert](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/douglas.gubert)
* **Description:** Rocket.Chat currently uses a third-party package to filter bad words. This poses a few problems, such as having to update the package every so often, having to check which words have been added or excluded in newer versions, and deciding if we would like to keep blocking or allowing words. This project is for building an App that can be enabled in our Marketplace to filter out a list of default bad words but will allow admins to add or delete words from that list. The app will need to cover the following requirements:
  * Create a UI for managing the App settings
  * Load a list of words from a URL
  * Add/Remove words from a list
  * Add/Remove channels where the bad words filtering is enabled (with a toggle for "all channels")
  * Provide statistics on blocked words and offending users
  * Automatically deactivate users that go above a certain threshold
* **Desirable Skills**: Familiarity with JavaScript and TypeScript. Knowledge in how to build Rocket.Chat Apps is a plus.

### **Houston Improvements - Rocket.Chat release/changelog generator**

* **Mentors:** [@rodrigo.nascimento](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/rodrigo.nascimento)
* **Project Channel:** [https://open.rocket.chat/channel/2dxywf7577zxgzark](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/2dxywf7577zxgzark)
* **Project Repository:** [https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Houston](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Houston)
* **Desirable Skills:** TypeScript, Git, Shell
* **Description:** Houston is the CLI tooling we use to release new versions of Rocket.Chat and generate our changelogs from merged pull requests. We want to:
  * Rewrite the tooling in TypeScript
  * Accept a new format of PR titles (conventional changelog)
  * Add a validation system for PRs titles via GitHub Actions
  * Add tooling to preview the generated changelog for the PR
  * Add new top level of separation for product type (like Enterprise and Community) based on labels
  * Support dependent repositories to import their changelogs, for example, import the changelogs of apps engine

### Add a bundler to the Apps-Compiler

* **Mentors**: [@douglas.gubert](https://open.rocket.chat/douglas.gubert)
* **Description**: Currently, the Apps-Compiler package uses the bare TypeScript compiler to process apps' code and generate the JS version. This has some limitations, e.g. we can't "simply" bundle the whole app in a single file, we can't bundle npm packages, and so on. By changing this compiler into a proper bundler (Webpack, Rollup, etc.), we would have access to a richer ecosystem of tooling to handle the compilation process of Rocket.Chat Apps.
* **Desirable Skills**: JS/TS, familiarity with bundlers (using them, not necessarily writing one) would be interesting

### **Stop notifications and Notifications schedule**

* **Mentors:** [@rodrigo.nascimento](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/rodrigo.nascimento)

  * **Notifications Schedule:** Option to configure (in user's settings) the availability time where notifications will be sent:
    * With the option to configure for every day from X time to Y time
    * With the option to configure for weekdays from X time to Y time
    * With the option to configure X and Y times for each day of the week manually
    * The same settings should be available for the workspace admin to configure a default value for all users
    * The implementation should cover the web and mobile applications

### **New statuses for user actions/events (Typing 2.0)**

This project aims to create the ability to integrate an existing Rocket.Chat server into Big Blue Button, replacing the existing embedded chat component.

### **Channel's Calendar View**

* **Mentors:** [@pierre.lehnen](https://open.rocket.chat/direct/pierre.lehnen)
* **Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with nodeJS full stack web app development. Experience with ReactJS is ideal.
* **Description:** Create a new option to see your activity in a channel in the format of a calendar, listing any action you had on each day. The listed actions would be things like: "joined discussion X", "created discussion Y", "sent messages on thread Z". This will help users find messages that they know they read/sent on a specific day but don't remember where.
