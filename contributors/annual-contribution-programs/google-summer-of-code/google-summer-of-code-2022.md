### Rocket.Chat ReactJS fullstack Component

**Mentor(s):** Rohan Lekhwani

**Description:** Create a ready-to-go easy to embed mini-chat React component. This component should be configurable to use any public channel on a Rocket.Chat server. Authentication should be flexibly configurable to existing Rocket.Chat server token, or via an independent IDM or auth service. The challenge here is to create a futuristic full-stack component that bundles tightly coupled backend behaviours with standard front-end ReactJS components (from Rocket.Chat Fuselage ReactJS library) - creating an amazing developer experience when developing In-App Chat applications.\
**Desired Skills:** ReactJS component creation experience, understanding of Rocket.Chat server internals

**Goals/Deliverables:** Standlone mini-chat React component that can be easily installed into any ReactJS based web app

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

### Chatbot Engine Connector: Botpress

**Mentor(s):** Frank Dase, Duda Nogueira

**Description:** Botpress is a popular open source framework for creation and execution of chatbots. This project extends a existing community-contributed Botpress connector to facilitate deployment of Botpress chatbots and Omnichannel bots. Focus here will include - better rich UI/UX / interaction support for bots and ability to run multiple instances of multiple bots.\
**Desired Skills:** Javascript and Typescript development. Keen interest in Bots and Chatbots.

**Goals/Deliverables:** A Rocket.Chat App as a Botpress connector. A couple of example chatbots (running in a channel, and running in omnichannel) plus documentation.

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

**Difficulty:** Medium

### Multi-bots support for Dialogflow App and Rasa App

**Mentor(s):** Murtaza Patrawala

**Description:** The idea here is to improve the existing Omnichannel Chatbot integrations (Dialogflow and Rasa), by allowing them to connect multiple chatbot accounts to a single [Rocket.chat](http://rocket.chat) server. Right now, the app is only equipped to deal with a single bot which means users can only interact with a bot within a single domain and a single language. But, if we allow connecting multiple bots via a single app, then we can solve this problem, thus allowing companies to serve chatbots in multiple languages, across multiple domains, right from a single [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) instance.

**Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with TypeScript development. Familiarity with [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) App's development framework\
\
**Goals/Deliverables:** Framework supporting the connection of multiple Dialogflow/Rasa bots to a single [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) instance.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)

**Difficulty:** Medium

### Rocket.Chat Golang SDK

**Mentor(s):** Cauê Felchar, Aaron Ogle

**Description:** Golang module to enable any Go package to talk to a Rocket.Chat server with ease, making it possible to create from custom clients to bots.

**Goals/Deliverables:**

* Create new models and update existing as needed
* Add receivers for top level endpoints for rest api according to [https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/rest-api](https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/rest-api/endpoints)
* Improve realtime module as needed and complete any missing receivers according to [https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/realtime-api](https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/realtime-api)
* Follow a test driven approach, add tests to each method to verify its robustness and evade regressions across releases

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)

**Difficulty:** Easy

### **Rocket.Chat for Virtual Conferences - Eventyay integration**

**Mentors:** Marcos Defendi, Sing Li

**Description:** Create a totally open source end-to-end solution for planning, management and running of online virtual events. Investigate integration with FOSSASIA's Eventyay platform for even planning and management. Day of event conference handling should be done by integrating RC4Community's virtual conference NextJS component with open-event-next - or create an even tighter integration with RC4Community.

**Desired Skills:** ReactJS and NextJS development experience. Fluent with Python development. Good understanding of video conference technology (such as Jitsi) and realtime chat platforms (such as Rocket.Chat).\
\
**Goals/Deliverables:** Open source virtual conference system integrating Rocket.Chat and Eventyay.

**Project Duration: 350** hours. (Large)

**Difficulty:** Hard

### Standalone Desktop Messaging cross-platforms Applet

**Mentor(s):** Jean Brito, Gabriel Casals

**Description:** Create a simpler desktop application similar to the old Google Talk (see [2005 GoogleTalk UI ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google\_Talk#/media/File:Google\_Talk\_Labs\_Edition\_\(screenshot\).png)here), is a simple channels list on a little window and each chat will open in another separated window, making it possible to talk with people without opening a big window. Making the usage of [Rocket.chat](http://rocket.chat) more seamless. This project will make extensive use of Rocket.Chat's In-App Chat APIs (REST APIs).

**Desired Skills:** Familiarity with ElectronJS and TypeScript.

**Goal/Deliverable:** Standalone app that is deployable on all platforms supported by Electron - Windows, Mac, Linux, and more. The App will display a listing window for the channels and open each chat on another window, making the chat more popup-like.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)

**Difficulty:** Medium

### Omnichannel users identity verification

**Mentor(s):** Kevin Aleman, Martin Schoeler

**Description:** This project investigates and implements a new and "native" identity verification mechanism for Omnichannel end-users, such as Live Chat visitors who, depending on the use case, have to provide personal data like email addresses, etc. [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) already has in place a similar confirmation mechanism for user verification, such as 2FA, email, etc. The contributor will have the freedom to propose ideas and design the best solution for the problem described.

**Desired Skills:** Familiarity with JavaScript development. Good understanding of the architecture of Rocket.Chat's Omnichannel implementation.

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

**Difficulty:** Medium

### **IRC Bridge : improve ease of deployment and stability**

**Mentors:** Gabriel Engel

**Description:** Rocket.Chat has long featured the ability to bridge directly witn IRC. IRC is still in use by many hard core technical open source communities all over the world, and this bridge is very important to many of our community users. However, since we started evolving our architecture to be more scalable, the IRC bridge has not been updated to match . As a result, it has become unstable in some edge cases and also difficult to deploy in scaled Rocket.Chat configuration. This project aims to improve the situation. The IRC bridge should be updated to be compatible with our scaled configuration. Extracting from core code base and repackaging as Rocket.Chat App or npm module should be investigated. Additional configuration/provisioning options and DevOps images will need to be created to improve the administrator's experience.

**Goals/Deliverables:** Familiarity with Typescript development. User of IRC and an understanding of how it works. An understanding of how Rocket.Chat scales.

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

**Difficulty:** Hard

### **Sidebar UI revamp and UX improvements**

**Mentors:** Ivan Netto, Tasso Evangelista, Gabriel Henriques

**Description:** Conversations in [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) can be done in multiple ways but at this stage, we need a scalable interface which would help users to maximize their daily tasks within the software. The following improvements would speed up users' workflow:

* Ability to collapse sidebar section;
* Add rooms straight from the its section header;
* Reduce the types of badge notifications, having to sizes will make the user interface more consistent and therefore, cleaner;
* Changes in the margins/paddings, which will bring a more robust visual hirarchy and scanning/reading experience;
* Changes in the colors to improve the readability.

**Goals/Deliverables:** Improve UX of daily basis tasks on a central touch point of the software.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)

**Difficulty:** Medium
