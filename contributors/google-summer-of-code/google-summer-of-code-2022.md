Authentication should be flexibly configurable to existing Rocket.Chat server token, or via an independent IDM or auth service. The challenge here is to create a futuristic full-stack component that bundles tightly coupled backend behaviours with standard front-end ReactJS components (from Rocket.Chat Fuselage ReactJS library) - creating an amazing developer experience when developing In-App Chat applications.\
**Desired Skills:** ReactJS component creation experience, understanding of Rocket.Chat server internals

**Mentor(s):** Murtaza Patrawala

**Description:** The idea here is to improve the existing Omnichannel Chatbot integrations (Dialogflow and Rasa), by allowing them to connect multiple chatbot accounts to a single [Rocket.chat](http://rocket.chat) server. Right now, the app is only equipped to deal with a single bot which means users can only interact with a bot within a single domain and a single language. But, if we allow connecting multiple bots via a single app, then we can solve this problem, thus allowing companies to serve chatbots in multiple languages, across multiple domains, right from a single [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) instance.

**Desirable Skills:** Familiarity with TypeScript development. Familiarity with [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) App's development framework\

However, since we started evolving our architecture to be more scalable, the IRC bridge has not been updated to match . As a result, it has become unstable in some edge cases and also difficult to deploy in scaled Rocket.Chat configuration. This project aims to improve the situation. The IRC bridge should be updated to be compatible with our scaled configuration. Extracting from core code base and repackaging as Rocket.Chat App or npm module should be investigated. Additional configuration/provisioning options and DevOps images will need to be created to improve the administrator's experience.
