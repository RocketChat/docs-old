# Google Season of Docs 2022

[![Google Season of Docs 2019](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsodlogo.png)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

[Season of Docs](https://g.co/seasonofdocs) is Google's annual program that fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers.&#x20;

Season of Docs is a unique program that pairs technical writers with open source mentors to introduce the technical writer to an open source community and provide guidance while the writer works on a real-world open source project. The technical writer, in turn, provides documentation expertise to the open source organization.

Projects can cover a wide range of fields including Cloud computing, operating systems, graphics, medicine, programming languages, robotics, science, security and many more. Season of Docs is not a recruiting program or an internship but it does provide invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!

## About our organization

Ultimate open source team chat and communications platform

Rocket.Chat is one of the largest active open source (permissive MIT source license) nodeJS communications platform communities on GitHub, connecting 1500+ global community contributors (across projects) from 30+ countries, with 31700+ GitHub stars, 6500 forks, 490+ total releases and 12,000+ issues since inception in 2015.

Rocket.Chat is a modern team chat and collaborating platform written in full-stack JavaScript. Rocket.Chat offers a full featured rich team chat experience on modern browsers, comparable to Slack and Microsoft Teams. Mobile and desktop clients run on iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux. Rocket.Chat server can scale from a small family messaging server for 5 users running on a Raspberry Pi 4, to clustered micro-services configuration that can support hundred thousands of users. On-premise deployment of Rocket.Chat can ensure 100% complete security and privacy of your valuable communications/data.

Rocket.Chat is now installed on over 500k servers and counts over 12m users worldwide. Rocket.Chat’s long-term vision is to replace email with a real-time federated communications platform globally.

Users can set up Rocket.Chat on cloud or by hosting their own servers on-premises. Thanks to its extension support via Rocket.Chat Apps (plugins), and extremely rich API/SDK support, startups and innovators have customized Rocket.Chat into new products and services. Chatbots extend the interactivity of Rocket.Chat and integrate external IT systems. Omnichannel extends reach to wherever user may be including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger and more.

Rocket.Chat has won multiple prizes such as a 2016 Bossie Award for Best Open Source Application and first prize in the 2017 edition of All Things Open’s Startup Competition.

Rocket.Chat supports over 59 local languages. Rocket.Chat's community interacts 24 x 7 at the community Rocket.Chat server https://open.rocket.chat since 2015.

## Project Idea

### Improve Rocket.Chat App Building Documentation

## About the project

### The problem

Rocket.Chat is one of the biggest open source team collaboration software in the world, with close to 1000 configuration options available to the admins out of the box today. And like with any other projects, the community requests more features to be added each day.&#x20;

Rocket.Chat App is our way of extending the product without changing the core. An app lets us extend Rocket.Chat by making it possible to&#x20;

* Add UI elements
* Add commands for grouped tasks
* Change the UI
* Schedule and automate workloads
* Change the whole user experience by plugging into different events
* Integrating with external APIs & services \
  &#x20;    ... and much more.&#x20;

The possiblity of anyone being able to add a feature they need or want to the product they use daily without having to go through the enormous code base and spending months getting up to speed, makes Rocket.Chat a unique and extremely attractive project in the community.

One of the core applications of this is connecting various open source projects together in the form of Integration Apps.&#x20;

This approach inevitably creates it's own ecosystem that the contributors need to be familiar with, which is why a detailed and well written documentation is a must to reach the community. Building a Rocket.Chat App is also a very well beginners' practice because of the ability to interact with a project of this scale while learning with smaller blocks. Without a good documentation not only the more experienced contributors are limited in their capabilities, but the newcomers to the community also gets limited in their exploration of open source development.

### Project's Scope

This project will

* Audit and collect existing documentation from READMEs, API references, GitBook, video tutorials like webinars and code comments to create a friction log.
* Use the friction log to identify gaps in existing documentation.
* Incorporate internal and community feedback to design the perfect layout and learning flow of new developers.&#x20;
* Update the guides and documentations on GitBook.
* Update current READMEs to help new contributors navigate to the right resources including how to create Rocket.Chat Apps and resources around Git and Pull Requests.
* Incorporate feedbacks from documentation testers (volunteers) and the wider Rocket.Chat community.
* Collaborate with project administrators to test the documentations and identify any opportunities of improvement.

### Measuring Success

### Timeline

Standard 3 months project.

## Project Budget

## Previous Experience
