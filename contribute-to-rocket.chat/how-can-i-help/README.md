## How can I help?

You can help in multiple ways - even if you don't write code, you can still contribute. We are always looking for assistance with creating or updating documentation, testing our web, desktop, and mobile apps and reporting bugs.

**Developers** who wish to make contributions, please go [here](developing.md) to start.

If you have found a **security** issue, [report it](security/).

Rocket.Chat is currently **translated** into more than twenty languages, but we've got a long way to go. If you'd like to assist us with this, please email our [translation team](mailto:translations@rocket.chat) to be invited to our [Lingohub](https://translate.lingohub.com) project.
