## Project Ideas

This list is being updated regularly, some project ideas are still subject to further refinement, and some projects without assigned mentors may be removed.

### Guided RC Code Walkthrough and Tutorial&#x20;

**Mentor(s):**   Kevin Aleman

**Description:** \
Most Rocket.Chat developers uses VSCode when studying our massive production code base, and when writing new code.   VSCode is the best environment for conducting interactive tutorial and code walkthroughs.  The CodeTour extension available in VSCode can be used to create such walkthrough and tutorials.  This project involves the development of a set of guided tutorials using CodeTour that will help new developers to understand how to perform multiple actions. Paths to be documented will go from this areas:

* How a message is sent
* How to create an endpoint
* How to add a new service
* How to create a DB model
* How to use DB models
* How services interact between them
* How to build a lib
* How to navigate monorepo (where is everything, how's imported, etc)

We welcome any additional ideas you may have.

**Desired Skills:** JNodeJS, MongoDB

**Goals/Deliverables:** A set of guided tours from the topics described above

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

**Difficulty:**  Easy/Medium\


### Moderation Console Mute User Action and Emoji Votes

### GitHub Pull request reminders app

**Mentors:** Murtaza Patrawala, Samad Khan

**Description:** \
Have you ever faced challenges keeping track of your pull request reviews as a student? This is a common problem faced by many development teams. That's why we propose developing a pull request reminder app for [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) as a part of the Google Summer of Code program. For now, weâ€™re isolating the scope of this project to GitHub.

The app's goal will be to provide regular reminders and updates to keep the review process moving and help ensure that pull requests are being reviewed and discussed in a timely manner. This project will be built on top of [this existing GitHub App](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Github22) which already has a bunch of boilerplate code to deal with authentications and GitHub APIs.

One approach to solving the issue of pending pull requests is to create a separate Rocket.Chat channels for each pull request (This is a proven strategy organizations already use on Slack. Check [here](https://axolo.co/blog/p/utlimate-slack-pull-request-reminder-bot) for more info). This way, all relevant stakeholders can be added to the channel, including the author of the pull request, the reviewers, and any other team members who need to be informed about the status of the review.

The Rocket.Chat channels can serve as a dedicated space for discussion and collaboration around each pull request. Users can receive notifications about updates to the pull request, such as new comments or changes to the code. This helps keep everyone informed and ensures the review process stays on track.

Example text message for Rocket.Chat channel:

* "ðŸ”” Attention reviewers! This pull request has been pending for \[number] days now. Let's make sure to give it the attention it deserves and keep the review process moving forward ðŸš€"

In addition, the users can also opt-in to receive a direct message from the bot at the start of their workday, with a comprehensive list of all the reviews that need his/her attention.

Example DM text messages:

1. "ðŸ‘€ Time to give those pull requests some love! You've got \[number] pending review(s) waiting for you. Don't keep your fellow developers waiting ðŸ˜Š"
2. "ðŸ”” Don't let those pull requests get forgotten! You've got \[number] waiting for your review. Let's get to work ðŸ’»"
3. "ðŸš€ It's time to move those pull requests forward! You've got \[number] waiting for your review. Give them the green light ðŸ’š"

By using Rocket.Chat channels to manage the review process, teams can improve the visibility of their pull requests and ensure that they are being reviewed and discussed in a timely manner.

PS: For more inspiration on how to solve this issue, please refer to some of these solutions on other platforms.

**Mentors:**  Debdut Chakraborty

**Description:**\
****The goal is to develop a bot that can help reduce repetitive questions asked in Rocket.Chat channels by providing relevant answers from its knowledge base (Similar to [this Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/ASAFS8C2D-truffle?tab=more\_info))

Features:

1. Knowledge base: The bot will have a knowledge base of all previously answered questions and their answers.
2. Real-time scanning: The bot will scan the Rocket.Chat channels in real-time for new questions and check if it has a relevant answer in its knowledge base.
3. Private response: If the bot finds a relevant answer, it will send the answer privately to the person who asked the question, without interrupting the public conversation.
4. Analytics (optional): The bot will keep track of the number of repetitive questions answered and provide analytics to the administrator.

Technologies to be used:

* [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) apps-engine
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Elasticsearch (a suggestion, but Iâ€™m open to any other good alternatives)

With Elasticsearch integrated into the tech stack, the bot can leverage the powerful search and analysis capabilities of Elasticsearch to efficiently search through the knowledge base and provide accurate answers to the user's questions. [Hereâ€™s](https://rebeccabilbro.github.io/intro-doc-similarity-with-elasticsearch/) a good blog to get started.

**Desirable Skills:**   Advanced knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP);  [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) apps-engine;  Experience using chosen indexing framework like ElasticSearch

**Goal/Deliverable:**  A Rocket.Chat app that suggests relevant answers to new messages in a channel, based on past messages. Plus an additional service is used for indexing messages.

### Full-stack Components Framework for Community Builders

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:**\
****Full-stack component is the holy grail of software componentization.  Imagine building a fully functional customized web portal in minutes by dragging and dropping full-stack components.   Each component not only contains interactive UI, but also associated mid-tier and server-side/severless behaviours as well as parameterizations.  Unfortunately the state of our current software art is not quite there yet.   The next best thing is actually  which solves the same problem but at a page level and not at the component-within-the-page level.\
\
RC4Community is a specialized componentized framework for community builders to rapidly create fully functional community portal.  It was designed to work with a full-stack component framework since day one - but had to use Next.js instead. &#x20;

This project involves the introduction of the missing architectural, build workflow, and packaging technology to enable full-stack components within the RC4Community context.

**Desirable Skills:**  ReactJS, JavaScript, Next.js, server-side technology, serverless technology, microservices.  A thorough understanding of how current component framework works.  In-depth understanding of modern devops technology.   In-depth understanding of JavaScript packaging technology and workflow. A passion for pushing the limits of modern componentized software development tools.

**Goal/Deliverable:**  A set of full stack components for community builders.  A framework that allows new components to be hosted on their own  independent repositories and be packaged into modules that can be installed over the network as needed (similar to npm model today).

### Template messages Rocket.Chat app

**Mentors:**  TBD

**Description:** \
This project aims to develop a [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) app that allows users to create, store, and send common messages with ease (Similar to [this Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/AJGJWCYPQ-templates?tab=more\_info)). The app will have a simple interface that enables users to create templates with customized names. These templates can be triggered using a slash command (e.g., /template \<template-name>) and inserted into the chat window with just one click. Users can also edit and delete their templates as needed.

The app will be built using [the Apps-Engine framework](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/rocket.chat-apps-engine) as a Rocket.Chat app. This app will improve productivity and streamline communication in Rocket.Chat, provides a convenient way for users to send common messages and save time in their daily work routine.
