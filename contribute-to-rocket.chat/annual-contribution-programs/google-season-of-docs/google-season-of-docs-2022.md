# Google Season of Docs 2022

[![Google Season of Docs 2019](https://github.com/Sing-Li/bbug/raw/master/images/gsodlogo.png)](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/)

[Season of Docs](https://g.co/seasonofdocs) is Google's annual program that fosters collaboration between open source projects and professional technical writers.

Season of Docs is a unique program that pairs professional technical writers with open source mentors to introduce the technical writer to an open source community and provide guidance while the writer works on a real-world open source project. The technical writer, in turn, provides documentation expertise to the open source organization.

Projects can cover a wide range of fields including Cloud computing, operating systems, graphics, medicine, programming languages, robotics, science, security and many more. Season of Docs is not a recruiting program or an internship but it does provide invaluable experience and looks great on a resume!

## Project Idea

### Improve Rocket.Chat App Building Documentation

## About the project

### The problem

Rocket.Chat can be extended through apps. Apps are considerably easier to code than modifying the large Rocket.Chat code base. But we are seriously lacking on documentation for Apps developers.

New app builders have a hard time navigating our existing meager documentation. There is a lack of details and current contents are difficult to understand. This makes building an app a very time consuming activity and causes developers to get frustrated or even abandon their projects.

As it exists today, it is very difficult to develop an app without getting help from an existing app developer or our internal team. The documentation is also not up to date - while the app platform is consistently being updated. Outdated documentation is causing more issues and slows down development ending up with more of the same questions asked multiple times.

### Project's Scope

This writer will

* Design the ideal layout and content flow which should improve the learning experience of new developers.
* Update the existing articles on GitBook with the help of GSoD administrator, including automatically generated API references, existing articles, webinar contents and code comments.
* Identify any gaps, as in missing pieces in the documentation.
* Fill the identified gaps by adding supporting documentation.
* Incorporate feedback from documentation testers (volunteer testers from our community) and the wider Rocket.Chat community.
* Collaborate with project administrators to validate and test the documentation and identify any opportunities of improvement.
* Update current READMEs to help new contributors navigate to the right resources including how to create Rocket.Chat Apps and resources around Git and Pull Requests.

### Measuring Success

* 50% increase in [@rocket.chat/apps-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rocket.chat/apps-cli) weekly downloads.
* Reduced number of common queries from the community.
* Increase in the number of members in [Developers of Rocket.Chat Apps](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/developers-of-rocket-chat-apps) team and the team channels on our Open Community Server.

### Timeline

Standard 3 month project.
