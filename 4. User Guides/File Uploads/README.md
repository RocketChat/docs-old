# File Uploads

Rocket.Chat accepts multiple file upload options.

You can configure these options by going to [Administration > File Upload](/5.%20Administrator%20Guides%2FFile%20Upload/).

When file uploads are available, there are three options available for sending your files:

- Click the attachment icon by the room message input box ![Attachment Icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1986378/14360192/9d49869c-fccb-11e5-8ff5-d240845da93a.png).
