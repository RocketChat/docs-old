# Inviting Users

After creating and setting up your new workspace, it is time to add users to your Rocket.Chat workspace.

You can start by creating your first user following this [guide](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/users/) on adding new users or inviting your colleagues to join your workspace.

Note that for self-managed workspaces, you need to have[ SMTP enabled and configured](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/email/setup.md) in order to be able to send emails through the workspace.
{% endhint %}
