# Roles in Rocket.Chat

Roles in Rocket.Chat makes it easy for you to manage, control and secure access to resources and features.

A Role can be tied to one or more [**Permissions**](../../use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-workspace-administration/permissions.md) allowing different users to have different levels of access based on the role assigned to them by the workspace Admin.

As a Rocket.Chat workspace administrator, you can assign certain privileges to users, such as the ability to send messages or manage channels. By assigning roles and permissions, it is possible to control and limit the actions of a user, ensuring that they are only able to access and perform the action that they are authorized to do so.

This document aims at listing out the various Roles in Rocket.Chat using the following categories:

* [Administrator Role](./#rocket.chat-administrator-role)
* [User Roles](./#rocket.chat-user-roles)
* [Omnichannel Roles](./#rocket.chat-omnichannel-roles)
* [Marketplace Roles](./#rocket.chat-marketplace-roles)

## Rocket.Chat Administrator Role

A Rocket.Chat Administrator has the `Admin` role, which gives them full access to the entire Rocket.Chat workspace.

They can manage both Workspace administration and Omnichannel settings.
