# Basic White-labeling

Leverage the white-labeling capabilities of Rocket.Chat to give your workspace the look and feel that suits your organization's brand.

To achieve this, you are required to be the workspace administrator having the [admin](roles-in-rocket.chat/) role.

The UI changes can be managed in the [layout.md](../use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-workspace-administration/settings/layout.md "mention") **** settings of your workspace.
