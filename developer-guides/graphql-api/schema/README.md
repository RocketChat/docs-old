# GraphQL API Schema

To see the GraphQL schema of the Rocket.Chat GraphQL API, you should use some GraphQL graphical tool. <br/>
These tools are able to show the schema, using the [Instropection tool](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) of GraphQL.<br/>
You can use the instrospection queries to show the schema, but by a graphical tool is easier.<br/>
Below we have some options of tools, and where you can see the schema in each of them.

**Graphical Tools:**

[GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) (You can see the schema by clicking on the green button("schema") on the right side). <br/>
[Altair GraphQL](https://altair.sirmuel.design/) (You can see the schema by clicking on the "Docs" button, which is on the left side of the "Send Request" button). <br/>
`GraphiQL` (GraphiQL is a tool provided by the API itself, just access the `{YOUR_HOST}/graphiql` endpoint and make sure the server is in **development** mode.
You can see the schema by clicking the "Docs" button in the upper right corner).
