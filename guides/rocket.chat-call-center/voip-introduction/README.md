# VoIP Introduction

Companies must be attentive at each stage of the customer journey — discovery, research, purchase, support, customer service, and returns, and building an ongoing relationship. **Omnichannel** means fulfilling customers’ needs at every touchpoint and providing the same functionality and experience across channels, no matter how a buyer chooses to interact. Simply put, omnichannel is about meeting customers wherever they are and providing excellent service at every touchpoint, like:

* Over the phone/Voice Channel
* Mobile apps
* Mobile messages, chats, and push notifications
* Social media
* Email

### **What is VoIP?**

**Voice over Internet Protocol** refers to the standards that facilitate voice-based phone calls using an internet connection instead of a local telephone company. With the rise of broadband, VoIP has become the definitive choice for phone service for consumers and businesses alike.

People enjoy using VoIP over traditional phone lines. Why? It offers many more capabilities than analog phones. And it can do it all for less than half the cost.

### How VoIP works?

Voice over IP converts your voice into a digital signal, compresses it, and sends it over the internet. A VoIP service provider sets up the call between all participants. On the receiving end, the digital data is then uncompressed into the sound that you hear through your handset.

### Why is VoIP Important for the Omnichannel environment?

In a contact center environment, Voice is an important and powerful channel. Agents using OmniChannel stack should be able to make audio/video calls to external PSTN networks, cellphone networks, and VoIP endpoints supporting SIP protocol.

Once Rocket.Chat media channel (Audio video channel) or VoIP is in place, our Enterprise Edition provides call center features such as queue monitoring, call center reporting, call spying, and barge-in. Along with these features, it is going to provide call recordings for quality control and compliance.
