# Marketplace Roles

With the most recent release of Marketplace, we have introduced roles. Internally, we have two different roles; one within the publisher and the second within the system. Henceforth known as publisher roles and system roles.

## Publisher Roles

There are three different roles within a Publisher.

* Owner
* Developer
* Viewer

as shown below:

The Owner role is applied whenever someone creates a publisher. Each of the subsequent roles only applies to people they have invited.

### Publisher: Owner

The owner can do everything.

An owner can change the role of another user, as shown below:

### Publisher: Developer

The developer can read everything. However, the developer role can also update Apps (can not create them, that requires an Owner).

### Publisher: Viewer

The viewer role can read everything but can not update anything.
