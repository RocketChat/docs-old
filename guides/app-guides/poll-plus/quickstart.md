This page demonstrates a very basic usage of the Poll app. For more advanced usage and to explore the Poll App's complete capabilities, please refer to the [Guides](https://github.com/RocketChat/docs/tree/5b094b49dc67c76d97a30a786a914ee16d5772b0/guides/mixed-visibility-polls.md) section.

After executing the `/poll` command, a pop-up will be triggered for the user to create the poll as below:

* **Add a choice:** Here you can add as many options you need for the poll if the poll type is single or multiple choice.
* **Vote type:** You can decide if the poll will have "open vote", "confidential vote" or "mixed vote".
