# Word Cloud

In addition to the bar graph generated, the Poll Plus App provides users with the option to summarize the poll results in a word cloud.

The word cloud feature makes use of a word cloud API for fetching these. If you haven't set a word cloud API to be used, please refer to the [configuration guide](https://github.com/RocketChat/docs/tree/5b094b49dc67c76d97a30a786a914ee16d5772b0/guides/app-guides/poll-plus/poll-plus-app-configuration/settings.md) for more information.

Word Cloud can be enabled by setting the word cloud property to **enabled** within the poll creation modal.
