2. Using the slash command `/google-drive files`

A list of all the files in your Drive is displayed here including those you created and the ones shared with you.

Files are listed with their respective `file name`, `Owner`, `file type` and `Last modified date`

You can search files using the search bar or filter what type of files should be shown.

## Open Google Drive Files

You have the ability to open up files in your browser directly from Rocket.Chat. Take for example before sharing a file, you may want to open the file first to view and verify its content.

To open a file in the browser, click the **Kebab menu** across the file then select **Open in browser.** This will open the file on your browser's tab

## Create a New Google Drive File

* You can create a new file directly within Rocket.Chat by any of the two means:&#x20;
  1. Clicking on **+New** from the opened contextual bar
  2. Using the slash command `/google-drive create`

This opens up a modal, fill in the **File name** and select the **File type** then **Create**
