**What you can do in the Sandbox**&#x20;

* You can use the Test API-KEY to send `text` **messages** and `text` **templates** to your phone number.&#x20;
* An **unlimited** amount of messages can be sent with the Sandbox.
* Your phone number acts like a **user** and can send and receive messages.&#x20;
* The number can be a **landline**, as long as it can use WhatsApp.
* You can switch the **endpoint** at any time.
* Each **Sandbox API Key** is linked to one phone number, and you can only send test messages to that phone number. If you wish to test messages with more than 1 number, then you should set up a test WhatsApp Business Account (Staging WABA) instead of Sandbox.

**What you can't do with the Sandbox:**

* You cannot share media files within the environment.
* **Templates** messages can be sent a maximum of 10 times. You can choose between 2 predefined templates.&#x20;
* Messages and Templates can be sent only to your **phone number**.
* We will only forward and trigger an **API** when your given number is involved.&#x20;
* We do not yet provide response information when you use the WhatsApp API.
* You only have access to the WhatsApp API.&#x20;
