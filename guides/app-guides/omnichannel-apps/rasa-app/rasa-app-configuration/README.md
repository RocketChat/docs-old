Click open your Rasa app to see the settings available to you as an administrator under the **Settings** tab.

Following are the settings available:

1. Set the[ name of the bot you have already configured](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/dialogflow-app/dialogflow-app-configuration/bot-user-configuration) in **Bot Username**. This is the user who will assist the conversations through Rasa integration.
2. **Rasa Server URL** is available inside your Rasa instance.
3. The Bot sends **Service Unavailable Message** to the visitor if service is unavailable.
4. The **Close Chat Message** is sent automatically when a chat is closed.
5. The Bot sends a **Handover Message** to the Visitor upon handover.
6. Upon bot-to-live agent handover, the visitor is transferred to **Default Handover Department Name.**
7. Enabling **Enable Callbacks** setting will allow the app to use only callback messages. This feature is useful when you are using Reminder messages in your RASA bot.
8. If **Hide Quick Replies** enabled, then all quick-replies will hide when a visitor clicks on any one of them.
9. Hit **Save.**
