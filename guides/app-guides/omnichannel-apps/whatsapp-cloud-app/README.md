The Rocket.Chat WhatsApp Cloud App provides direct communication between Rocket.Chat and WhatsApp using the WhatsApp Cloud API without the need for any third-party services like 360Dialog.

This is possible by linking Rocket.Chat through a [Facebook Developer app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) with the WhatsApp setup.&#x20;
