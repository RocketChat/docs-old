# App Guides

## Where to find Rocket.Chat Apps?

There are a number of apps available to increase the quality of your team's workflow. You can add gif to spice up the chat or connect it with GitLab so that the team gets notified of new code changes.

You can browse these apps either on our [marketplace](https://rocket.chat/marketplace) or access them directly from the Admin Panel.

## How to install Rocket.Chat Apps?

In order to install Rocket.Chat apps from the marketplace, first you need to register your workplace (even if it is a community edition ) on [Rocket.Chat Cloud](https://cloud.rocket.chat).

Once your workplace is registered, you can install the apps from the marketplace from the Admin panel of your Rocket.Chat instance.
