In Rocket.Chat you can initiate video and audio conferences using your chosen provider in:

1. [Direct call (within _Direct Messages)_](conference-call-users-guide.md#direct-messages)__
2. [Conference call (within _Teams_, _Channels_, _Discussion_, _Multiple Direct Messages_)](conference-call-users-guide.md#conference-call)

## Direct Messages

### Initiating a direct call

Click the **phone** icon to initiate a direct call from within a _Direct Message_ **** conversation, as shown below:

After confirmation, a call pop-up appears in the top right corner and the ringer starts. This enables you to perform other actions while you wait for the receiver to answer. The ringer stays active for 30s, after that **Call again** button appears in the channel.  &#x20;
