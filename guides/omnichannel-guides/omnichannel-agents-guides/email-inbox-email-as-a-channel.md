# Email Inbox \(Email as a Channel\)

Once an email is part of a channel, your contacts can send emails to it to start a conversation. It will appear inside Rocket.Chat just like any other omnichannel livechat conversation. When you reply to an email message that has been sent to you, it will appear just like any other email in your contact’s inbox.

As soon as your contact sends an email to the registered email address, it will appear in the queue just like any other omnichannel conversation, as shown below:

Click **Take it!** to take it off of the **Queued Chats** and be able to reply to it:

As soon as you take it, it will appear in **Chats in Progress** and, you can click **Reply via Email** to reply to it.

## Invite a fellow agent to an email inbox

Suppose you get an email and you need the assistance of your fellow agent on it; you can invite them to this inbox using `/invite @username`.

They are invited to the channel, as shown below:

{% hint style="info" %}
As soon as the fellow omnichannel agent is invited to an email inbox, they are all able to see all the old conversation that has happened before they arrival to that email inbox.
{% endhint %}

And you can conversate with them internally on the same channel.
