# Configure asterisk manager interface and users

Lastly, Rocket.Chat needs an AMI connection to be able to read your Asterisk configuration and connect extensions to RC users.

So, navigate to the **Settings > Asterisk Manager Users** menu. Here you can create a user to be used by Rocket.Chat and limit the access of this user only to the IP address or network where your Rocket.Chat is.

You can now proceed to Rocket.Chat and [start configuring the voice channel there.](../configure-with-an-active-pbx-server/)
