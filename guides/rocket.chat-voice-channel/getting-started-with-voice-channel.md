# Getting Started with Voice Channel

To use any Rocket.Chat products, you need to sign up for an [**Enterprise Edition free trial**](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/enterprise-edition-trial) or have [Rocket.Chat community version deployed](https://docs.rocket.chat/quick-start/deploying-rocket.chat). If you already have an account and our other solutions please proceed.

Please note that:

* A **private branch exchange (PBX)**  is a telephone system within an enterprise that switches calls between users on local lines while enabling all users to share a certain number of external phone lines.&#x20;
* **Asterisk** is an open-source software implementation of a **PBX**.&#x20;
* **FreePBX** is a web-based open source GUI (graphical user interface) that controls and manages Asterisk (PBX).

**To set up a voice channel you have two paths:**
