# HipChat Cloud

To start importing values from HipChat you first need to have an instance of Rocket.Chat running. You can do that on [your own](https://docs.rocket.chat/developer-guides/quick-start/).

If you already have an instance running and administration privileges, you can follow these steps:

1. Export data from HipChat
2. Wait until your download is ready and download it (it will be a .zip file)
3. Go to `https://[your_rocket_chat].rocket.chat/admin/import` and click the "Start" button on the "HipChat" item
4. Choose your downloaded .zip file and wait until Rocket.Chat can read it (it can take a few minutes, depending on the size of your HipChat export)
5. Deselect any items you **don't** want to import
6. At the top of the page, click on **Start Importing**
