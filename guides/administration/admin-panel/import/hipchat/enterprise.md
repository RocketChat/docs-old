# HipChat Server / Data Center

To import your current data from HipChat Server / Data Center into Rocket.Chat, please do the following.

## Export from HipChat Server / Data Center

This is a copy from the HipChat Server / Data Center Documentation:

1. Browse to the fully qualified domain name you've configured for your HipChat Server, for example `https://hipchat.yourcompany.com/`
2. Log in to the web user interface (UI) using your administrator email and password
3. Click **Server admin > Export**
4. To include files and one-to-one chat history in the export, select the checkboxes
5. In the **Password** and **Confirm Password** fields, create a password to protect your archive file. You're required to provide this password when you import your data into HipChat Server. We don't store this password, so be sure to remember it
6. Click **Export**. Depending on how much data you have, it may take a few hours to export the data.  When it's finished, you'll receive an email with a link to download the file
7. When you receive the email, click the link in the email to download the archive file

## Import into Rocket.Chat

1. Decrypt the exported file: `openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in path_to_encrypted_file.tar.gz.aes -out path_to_decrypted_file.tar.gz -pass pass:your_password` See the table below for descriptions of the command line arguments
2. Ensure the file generated is a `tar.gz` file, otherwise Rocket.Chat won't accept it
3. Go to `https://[your_rocketchat]/admin/import/prepare/hipchatenterprise`
4. Choose your decrypted `tar.gz` file and wait until Rocket.Chat can read it (it can take a few minutes, depending on the size of your export)
5. Deselect any items you **don't** want to import
6. At the top of the page, click on **Start Importing**

### OpenSSL Command Arguments

| Argument      | Notes                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `aes-256-cbc` | This is the cipher to use to decrypt the file.                            |
| `-d`          | This argument is the command to decrypt the file.                         |
| `-in`         | Use this to specify the path to the archive file you're about to decrypt. |
| `-out`        | Use this to specify the path where you want to output the decrypted file. |
| `-pass pass:` | Enter the password you created when you **exported** the archive file.    |

## Troubleshooting

1. In case you get `digital envelope routines:EVP_DecryptFinal_ex:bad decrypt:../crypto/evp/evp_enc.c:541:` while decrypting add the parameter `-md md5` see [https://www.openssl.org/docs/faq.html#USER3](https://www.openssl.org/docs/faq.html#USER3)
2. If the import fails for large HipChat exports it may help to _not_ export file attachments. see [https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/11693](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/issues/11693)
3. If you still have problems contact us at support@rocket.chat and provide your server logs if available
