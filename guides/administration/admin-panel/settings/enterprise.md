# Enterprise

Use this setting to manually update your enterprise license. See this section on how to get [Enterprise License](../../../enterprise-edition-trial/).

{% hint style="info" %}
If your workspace is registered and the license is provided by Rocket.Chat Cloud you don't need to manually update the license here.
{% endhint %}

To access this setting, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Enterprise**.

* **Enterprise License**: A field to enter your enterprise license.
* **Status**: This shows the current status of your applied license whether it is valid or invalid.

When all your changes are done, hit the **Save changes** button to commit it.
