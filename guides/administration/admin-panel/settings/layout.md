# Layout

The layout feature gives you the possibility to customize the look of your Rocket.Chat server.

This involves aspects like colors, content, CSS and Javascript. Using this feature gives you the ability to fully give your Rocket.Chat server a unique and different look.

To access this setting, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Layout**.

{% hint style="success" %}
Remember to always **Save changes** and refresh to apply any customization made.
{% endhint %}

## Colors

This section has color settings and definitions you can edit or customize to have a different look on your UI elements.

{% hint style="info" %}
A list of Rocket.Chat's pre-defined color variables can be found on \*\*\*\* [**the repository**.](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/blob/b092bef8139f9db692872073ce9788c19b364780/app/theme/client/imports/general/variables.css)
{% endhint %}

Colors can be set using existing **Expressions** or **Color** by specifying it from the color picker provided.

* **Login Terms:** Specifies the terms on which users are to accept before login in.

* **Privacy Policy:** Here you can set the privacy policy of your server. Can also be accessed via YOUR-SERVER-URL/privacy-policy. This is shown by default on the links below your login page.

## Custom CSS

Here, you can define custom CSS that will be applied to your server's layout.

### Example

A simple CSS styling to the wrapper class like this will transform your server into a whole new look.

```
.wrapper {
	background-color: #062d33;
}
```

## Custom Scripts

This takes in javascript code that will be executed on specified events.

* **Custom Script for Logout Flow**: Set a script to be run during any logout process.
* **Custom Script for Logged Out Users**: Custom Script that will run ALWAYS and to ANY user that is NOT logged in. e.g. (whenever you enter the login page).
* **Custom Script for Logged In Users**: Custom Script that will run ALWAYS and to ANY user that is logged in. e.g. (whenever you enter the chat and you are logged in)

### Example

Setting a custom script for logged in users, like the example below, will alert "Welcome" whenever a user logs in and is on the `/home` page.

```
if(window.location.pathname == '/home'){
    alert("Welcome")
}
```

## Fonts

Here, you set the fonts to be used on your server.

* **Body Font Family**: Takes in a list of comma-separated font families. Rocket.Chat will start using the most available from left to right.

## Old Colors

This section has a list of color swatches used in older versions of RocketChat. They can be edited and customized still. Learn more about color properties and what they affect in [this guide](../../basic-white-labeling.md#colors).

## Old Colors(minor)

A list of variable names and some old minor colors used before. See the color section above for more detail.

## User Interface

* **Display Roles:** Toggles the display of user roles shown beside the usernames on messages.

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (663) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

* **Group Channels By Type:** Enabling this will separate the channels by category (**Channel**, **Private Room**, **Direct Message** or **Discussion**) on the left sidebar.
* **Use Full Name Initials to Generate Default Avatar:** This will make so the default avatars are generated using the person's Full Name instead of Username. E.g. By default the user `blue.ducks` with the name `Richards Nate` will have an avatar with the letters `BD`by default but if this setting is active, it will be `RN`.
* **Use Real Name:** Enabling this will change the display of Usernames to Full Names
* **Click to Create Direct Message:** Enabling this will make it so when you click an avatar, it will open a Direct Message with the selected user and skip viewing the user's profile.
* **Number of users' autocomplete suggestions**: Sets the number of autocomplete suggestions shown when you begin tagging any user with the `@` symbol.
* **Unread Counter Style**:
  * **Different Style for user mentions:** This will make the notification counter differentiate normal messages from mentions
  * **Same style for mentions:** This will make the count mark mentions and normal messages the same
* **Allow Special Characters in Room Names:** When enabled, it allows for the use of special characters like `! @ # $ % ^ & *` in room names
* **Show top navbar in embedded layout:** If set to true, it shows the top navbar when using `?layout=embedded` at the end of the URL.
