# WebRTC

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that allows Web apps and sites to record and potentially broadcast audio and/or video material, as well as transmit arbitrary data between browsers without the need for a middleman.

To access this setting, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **WebRTC**.

* **Enable for Public Channels**: WebRTC will be enabled for all public channels if set to true.
* **Enable for Private Channels**: When enabled, private channels will have WebRTC.
* **Enable for Direct Messages**: If set to true, direct messages will have WebRTC.
*   **STUN/TURN Servers**: A list of STUN and TURN servers separated by a comma.

    Username, password, and port are allowed in the format `username:password@stun:host:port` or `username:password@turn:host:port`.
