    Format for this is PEM WITH `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`
* **Signature Validation Type**: Select the type of signature validation. _`This setting will be ignored if no Custom Certificate is provided`**.**_

### Mapping

* **User Data Field Map**: Configure how user account fields (like email) are populated from a record in SAML (once found). As an example, `{"name":"cn", "email":"mail"}` will choose a person's human-readable name from the cn attribute, and their email from the mail attribute. Available fields in Rocket.Chat: `name`, `email` and `username`, everything else will be discarded.

```json
"email": "mail",
  "username": {
    "fieldName": "mail",
    "regex": "(.*)@.+$",
    "template": "user-__regex__"
  },
  "name": {
   "fieldNames": [
      "firstName",
      "lastName"
    ],
    "template": "__firstName__ __lastName__"
  },
  "__identifier__": "uid"
}
```
