# IRC

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a text-based group communication tool. Users join uniquely named channels, or rooms, for open discussion. IRC also supports private messages between individual users and file-sharing capabilities. This package integrates these layers of functionality with Rocket.Chat.
