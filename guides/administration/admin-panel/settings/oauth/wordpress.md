# WordPress OAuth Setup

The easiest way to configure Rocket.Chat using WordPress as your identity backend is to use the MiniOrange oAuth Plugin Version 2.5.6 or higher: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-oauth-20-server/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-oauth-20-server/)

## Instructions

* Sign into your Rocket.Chat instance with an administrator account.
* Proceed to the `oAuth` section under `Administration`.
* Click on **Add custom oAuth** to create a new OAuth Application, as depicted below:

* In the **Application Configuration** tab, copy the `Callback URL` \(example: `http://your.domain.com/_oauth/id`\), and put it into a notepad, or another text application, as we will need it in the next few steps.
* Log into your WordPress site as an administrator and navigate to **Add New** under `Plugins`.
* Search for "MiniOrange oAuth Server" \(Red below\).
* Install and activate the `MiniOrange oAuth Server` plugin \(Purple, and then Green\).

* It now shows your `Client ID` \(Red\) and `Client Secret` \(Purple\). Copy them into the same notepad, or another text application where you have your Callback URL.

* Click the **Endpoints** tab, and copy each line from the purple box to your notepad. Don't forget to note the endpoint each line represents.

* Go back to the custom oAuth you already created in Rocket.Chat, and match the information saved in the notepad into the correct fields listed below and in the screenshot:
* **Enable** = True
* **URL** = `https://your.domain.com` \(do not include a trailing ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ/ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ\)
* **Token Path** = Access Token Endpoint
* **Token Sent Via** = Payload
* **Identity Token Sent Via** = Payload
* **Identity Path** = Get User Info Endpoint
* **Authorize Path** = Authorize Endpoint
* **Scope** = Profile
* **Id** = Client ID
* **Secret** = Client Secret
* **Login Style** = Redirect \(you can use any of them, but redirect is really the only one that plays nice with mobile and desktop apps\)
* **Username field** = username \(a normal hook for a WordPress username is user\_login, but the plugin rewrites this in the JSON response to Rocket for username\)
* **Merge users** = true

### Button Customization

In regards to the customization of the **Log in** button, you can customize it without affecting oAuth working.

**Note**: When using mobile and desktop apps, your imputed **Button** text is not displayed. Instead, the apps will display your custom oAuth name at the top.

### Troubleshooting oAuth

The first thing to do when having an issue with oAuth is to enable `Level 2 Logging` to see what's going on: `Administration > Logs > Log Level > View Logs`.

When looking at the logs, you may want to open an incognito mode browser window for the log in screen, and have the logs and your login screen side-by-side. When you attempt a login, the log displays the oAuth response in real time, which gives you valuable information to help you troubleshoot your issue.
