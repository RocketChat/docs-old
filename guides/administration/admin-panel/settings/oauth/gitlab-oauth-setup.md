# GitLab OAuth Setup

To use GitLab OAuth on your Rocket.Chat server, you are required to have a GitLab `URL`, `Id` and `Secret` gotten from the GitLab application.

Follow these steps to enable GitLab OAuth on your server.

* First, go to [Gitlab Application](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/applications)
