Note that for self-managed instances you need to have [SMTP enabled](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/settings/email/setup#set-up-your-credentials) in order to be able to send emails through the workspace. If you wish not to do so, you can still [invite users by creating their credentials](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/admin-panel/users/add-new-users).
