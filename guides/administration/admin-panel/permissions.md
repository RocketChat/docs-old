# Permissions

Rocket.Chat has a vast and customizable permissions system. Most of the actions a user can make require certain permission so you can customize what users can do and see.

To access this menu,

Permission changes are immediate and transparent. Users do not need to log out, log in, or refresh to change permissions.

## Roles

A `Role` is a set of permissions that can be given to users. Rocket.Chat already comes with a set of default roles that can be edited. You can also create new roles for users.

When someone is registered in a Rocket.Chat server, they will normally receive the `user`. If the user is a bot or a guest from a Live Chat channel, it can receive different roles. Also, the first user of a server always receives the role of `admin`.

Roles can have different scopes. Currently, we have two scopes `Users` and `Subscriptions`. The permissions of the `Users` roles are valid for the whole server, while the `Subscriptions` roles only apply to individual channels, where a user has to be elected to that role in that channel.

An example of `Users` role would be an `admin`, that have permissions valid for the whole server, while a `moderator` that have a `Subscriptions` role would have permissions only in a channel that they were elected for that role.

Also, by default roles are shown as little tags on the side of a username on messages.

### Default Roles

* **admin** `(Users)` - Have access to all settings and administrator tools.
* **moderator** `(Subscriptions)` - Have moderation permissions for a channel. Has to be elected by a channel owner.
* **owner** `(Subscriptions)` - Have owner permissions for a channel. When a user creates a channel they become the owner of that channel. They can also elect more owners for that channel.
* **user** `(Users)` - Normal user rights. Most users receive this role when registering.
* **bot** `(Users)` - Special Role for bot users, with some permissions related to bot functionality.
* **leader** `(Subscriptions)` - it doesn't have any special permissions, but is used when setting a `leader` to a channel. Leaders appear on the header of a channel.
* **anonymous** `(Users)` - unauthenticated users that access the server when the `Allow Anonymous Read` setting is activated.
* **guest** `(Users)` - anonymous users that want to write and participate in channels when the `Allow Anonymous Read` and `Allow Anonymous Write` settings are activated.
* **livechat-agent** `(Users)` - Agents of Live Chat. They can answer to Live Chat requests.
* **livechat-manager** `(Users)` - Manager of Live Chat, can manage agents and guests.
* **livechat-guest** `(Users)` - Users coming from a Live Chat channel.
