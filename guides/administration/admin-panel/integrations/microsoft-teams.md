# Microsoft Teams

## Goal

* Receive message from Microsoft Teams (**Incoming WebHook**)
* Send message to Microsoft Teams Channel(**Outgoing WebHook**)

## Create Incoming WebHook in Rocket.Chat

_**Note:** I would advise to create New Team so not all members in your organisation have access to this Integration_

1. **Create Incoming Webhook with Default parameters:**
   * Go to **Integrations** --> Create **New integration** --> Select **Incoming WebHook**
   * Assign **Name**
   * Assign **Post to Channel** (This will be the Channel where you want to receive msg from Teams)
   * Assign **Post as** (Create Bot user and add bot the above mentioned Channel)
   * Copy and paste below script in **Script** section

{% hint style="info" %}
The number 16 in the following script (`request.content.text.slice(16)`) should be updated to **`9 + MS Teams bot username length`**. This command is used to remove the bot tag from the text received from MS Team so that only the message is displayed in Rocket.Chat (e.g. if the bot username in MS Teams is rocket.bot, which is 10 characters long, then 16 should be updated to 19 = 9 + 10).
{% endhint %}

```javascript
class Script {
    process_incoming_request({ request }) {
        // UNCOMMENT THE BELOW LINE TO DEBUG IF NEEDED.
        // console.log(request.content);
        if ('edited_message' in request.content) {
            request.content = request.content;
        }
        let from = request.content.from;
        let who = from.name;
        let icon_url = '/avatar/' + from.name + '.jpg'
        let body = request.content.text.slice(16);

        if(!body) {
          if(request.content.hasOwnProperty("sticker") && request.content.sticker.emoji) {
            // It's a sticker
            body = request.content.sticker.emoji
        } else {
           return {}
          }
        }

	return {
		content: {
			username: who,
                	icon_url: icon_url,
                	text: body,
		},
		response: {
			type: "message",
			attachments: [{
				contentType: "application/vnd.microsoft.card.adaptive",
				content: {
					type: "AdaptiveCard",
					version: "1.4",
					body: [{
						type: "TextBlock",
						text: "Message received",
					}],
				},
			}],
		}
	};
    }
}
```

1. **Save** and then open your **Incoming WebHook** You should be able to see **Webhook URL** just **copy** that, We will need that during Creating **Outgoing WebHook** in MS Teams.

## Create Outgoing WebHook in MS Teams:

1. Select the appropriate team and select **Manage team** from the (**•••**) drop-down menu.
2. Choose the **Apps** tab from the navigation bar.
3. From the window's lower right corner select Create an **outgoing webhook**.
4.  In the resulting popup window complete the required fields:

    * **Name** - The webhook title and @mention tap. (This will be your bot name in MS Teams)
    * **Callback URL** - Paste the URL here we copied from Rocket.Chat.
    * **Description** - A detailed string that will appear in the profile card and the team-level App dashboard.
    * **Profile Picture** (optional) an app icon for your webhook.
    * Select the **Create** button from lower right corner of the pop-up window and the outgoing webhook will be added to the current team's channels.

    _**Note :**_ _The Name We mentioned above will be the bot name so when you send message to Rocket.Chat Mention to Bot example @namebot_

                      context: 'http://schema.org/extensions',
                      type: 'MessageCard',

                                  text: request.data.user_name.bold() + ": " + request.data.text,
                      //                      text: encodeURIComponent( request.data.user_name.bold() + request.data.text)
                    },
                 //   method: 'GET'
