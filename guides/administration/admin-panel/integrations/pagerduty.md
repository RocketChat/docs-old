# PagerDuty

[PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.com) is an alarm aggregation and dispatching service for system administrators and support teams. It collects the alerts from your monitoring tools, gives you an overall view of all of your monitoring alarms, and alerts an on-duty engineer if there's a problem.

* **Post as:** Choose the username that this integration will post as. The user must already exist.
* **Alias (optional):** Choose the alias that will appear before the username in messages.
