# Threads

Rocket.Chat Threads can be used to organize your chats into folders, instead of having every single message come in one under the other, you can click and reply to individual messages so that it opens up a different view just for that conversation.

To access this setting, go to **Administration** > **Settings** > **Threads**.

* **Enable**: When enabled, users will be able to create threads in conversations, otherwise, it would not allow for threads to be used.
