# Check Historical Edits and Deletions of Messages

Rocket.Chat recommends the following setting preferences to enable you to view any modified or removed messages.

* Go to the Administration
* Scroll down to **Messages** on the left-side menu.

Make sure to set your message preferences as follows:

* Enable **Allow Message Editing** and **Keep Per Message Editing History** to see a history of all messages and not only the last edit made.
* Disable **Allow Message Deleting**, otherwise, messages show only the _message deleted_ status and you cannot see the complete message history.
