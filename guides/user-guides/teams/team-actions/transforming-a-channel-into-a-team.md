# Transforming a channel into a team

{% hint style="warning" %}
This action cannot be undone! So please be very careful when transforming a channel into a team.
{% endhint %}

The channel owner is able to transform an existing channel into a team at any time. The channel needs to belong to the workspace (can not belong to a team) otherwise the option to transform in a team is not available.

To transform a channel into a team:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (380).png>)

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (381).png>)

The channel is successfully converted into a team:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (382).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that a private channel converts to a private team and a public channel converts to a public team.&#x20;
