# Mark Channel as Favorite

To help organize and prioritize your communications, you can **favorite** \(or **star**\) channels, private groups, and DMs.

To favorite a channel, click the **star** icon to the left of the channel header.

Favoriting a channel moves it to a **Favorites** section on the channels list, making it easier to access and find.
