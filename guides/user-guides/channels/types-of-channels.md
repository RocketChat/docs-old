# Types of Channels

There are three kinds of channels: [public channels](./#public-channels), [private groups](./#private-groups), and [direct \(1-on-1\) messages](./#direct-messages).

## Public channels ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/2021-04-24_02-19-38.jpg)

**Public channels** \(also called **channels** for short\) act as a base for all channel types. Use channels for conversations that are open to your entire team. Anyone on your team can join a channel.

Channels make it easy to find what's going on with your team. New team members can join a channel and read all the information previously shared by other users.

When in doubt, create a channel. Public conversations help you build a knowledge base of your organization with minimal effort. For example, create a channel for a company department or to discuss a specific programming language.

## Private groups ![](../../../.gitbook/assets/2021-04-24_02-15-58%20%281%29.jpg)

**Private groups** are closed channels. They are visible only to their members. Use private groups for subjects that are sensitive, confidential, or limited to a small group of team members.

Private groups are joined through invitation only. The administrator sets the permissions that determine who can invite others to a private group. By default, only administrators, room owners, and moderators can invite others to private rooms.

## Direct Messages

**Direct messages \(DMs\)** are a private 1-on-1 conversation between team members. They can be sent to any user on your server.

**Direct Messages Between Multiple Users** There is a feature that allows you to chat with multiple users inside a DM. For more info check: [Direct Messages Between Multiple Users](../direct-messages-between-multiple-users.md).
