# Create a new Team

You can leverage teams for specific discussions and topics. When creating a team, it’s possible to define both permission and encryption levels for its channels:

* Read Only: Allow users from the team to write messages or simply receive them
* Encrypted: Enables end-to-end encryption across all messages exchanged by the team
* Broadcast: Only authorized users can write new messages, but the other users will be able to reply
