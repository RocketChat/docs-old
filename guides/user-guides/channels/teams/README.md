# Teams

The feature takes the hassle out of managing one by one and allows managing multiple users at once by providing a digital workspace to facilitate your collaboration with teammates on Rocket.Chat.\
Each team can have its own channels, which can be public or private. Teams allow you to handle multiple users at the same time efficiently. So you don’t need to go through the manual process of adding users repetitively.

* Following is the team's symbol
