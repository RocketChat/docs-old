# Two Factor Authentication User Guide

With the ability to extensively use Rocket.Chat on multiple platforms, there's also a risk of exposing your account details.

Luckily, it’s easy for you to add an extra level of protection to your accounts in the form of two-factor authentication, also commonly referred to as 2FA.

2FA increases the security of your account. Even if somebody guesses your password, they won’t be able to access your account without the second factor of confirmation you have in your possession.

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, 2FA is enabled with the email you used for signing up on the server.
{% endhint %}

## Enabling Two Factor Authentication

To enable 2FA on your account,&#x20;

* Click on your **User Panel** then navigate down to **My Account**

TOTP is Time-based One Time Password. It is a very common form of 2FA.

{% hint style="info" %}
TOTP works by generating a unique numeric password with a standardized [algorithm](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238). The time-based passwords are made available and provide user-friendly, increased account security when used as a second factor.
