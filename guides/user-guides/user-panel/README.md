The **User Panel** is divided into three main sections:

* **Name and Current Status:** Displays the user name and the current status selected by the user
* **Status Selection:** The second section shows the statuses available for the end-user to choose: online, away, busy, or invisible.
  * The _Edit Status_ option allows the user to customize their status by adding a custom status message
* **My Account and Logout**
