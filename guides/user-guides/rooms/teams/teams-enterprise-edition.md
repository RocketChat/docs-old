# Teams Enterprise Edition

## Enterprise Edition ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (338).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
To be released in 3.14
{% endhint %}

The Enterprise edition should bring all functionalities available in Community Edition and additionally the ones below:

### Mention teams

With Teams, you donÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂt need to remember everyoneÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs name to communicate with a team quickly. Just mention a Team ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ @engineers, for instance ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ and all members will be instantly notified. This feature is currently available for Enterprise customers.

### AD / LDAP Sync

Using Teams is a piece of cake for IT teams that already mapped their organizationÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs teams through Active Directory Groups or Keycloak. The feature connects Rocket.Chat to your companyÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs infrastructure at ease, so whenever you update a department or user information, Rocket.Chat will receive those updates in real-time too.

ThatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs particularly beneficial if you manage large teams, constantly creating or deactivating members. The feature ensures that as you update your workgroups and new members are added or deleted, Rocket.ChatÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs teams are automatically aligned with it. This feature is expected for the next release (May).
