# Create a new Team

You can leverage teams for specific discussions and topics. When creating a team, itâ€™s possible to define both permission and encryption levels for its channels:

* **Read Only**: Allow users from the team to write messages or simply receive them
* **Encrypted**: Enables end-to-end encryption across all messages exchanged by the team
* **Broadcast**: Only authorized users can write new messages, but the other users will be able to reply
