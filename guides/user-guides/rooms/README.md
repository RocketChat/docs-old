# Rooms

Rooms make workflows structured, purpose-oriented and coherent. You can make them for any, subject, project, or team. Teams can share thoughts and information and push work ahead.

## Unread messages

Rooms with new messages appear bolded.

When using the **Unread Mode**, a new section called **Unread** appears on the left sidebar. All rooms with unread messages move to this new section until the messages have been read.

To activate Unread Mode, go to **My Account**> **Preferences**. Change the **Sidebar channel list mode** setting to **Unread Rooms Mode**.

## Mentions

When someone mentions you with `@username`, `@all` or `@here`, a symbol or a number will appear alongside the channel name. When mentioned, a `@` symbol appears next to your name. If someone mentions `@all` or `@here` a number will show up showing the number of times the mention is specific to you.

## Notifications Preferences

There are several notification settings a user can customize to Rooms. To find notification settings for a specific room, go to the room and click the **More** symbol at the top-right of the chat view. Then, select **Notification Preferences**.

* **Mute/Receive alerts:** Receive or mute any notifications from a room.
* **Mute/Receive mentions:** Receive or mute notifications for mentions while receiving notifications for messages in a room.
* **Hide/Show counter:** Show the number of unread messages for a room.
* **Notification sound:** Choose a sound for notifications besides the alerts default **Desktop**. Mobile currently supports only the alerts inside your mobile device. You can also select when to play the alert, the duration of the alert, and the alert itself.

> There are some default choices for audio provided by Rocket.Chat. However, you also get to choose custom audio files for the same. Get further information about [Custom Sounds](broken-reference).
