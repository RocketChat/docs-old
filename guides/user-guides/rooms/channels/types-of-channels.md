# Types of Channels

There are three kinds of channels: [public channels](./#public-channels), [private groups](./#private-groups), and [direct (1-on-1) messages](./#direct-messages).

## Public Channels ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2021-04-24\_02-19-38.jpg)

**Public Channels** (also called **channels** for short) act as a base for all channel types. Use channels for conversations that are open to your entire team. Anyone on your team can join a channel.

Channels make it easy to find what's going on with your team. New team members can join a channel and read all the information previously shared by other users.

When in doubt, create a channel. Public conversations help you build a knowledge base of your organization with minimal effort. For example, create a channel for a company department or to discuss a specific programming language.

## Private Channels ![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/2021-04-24\_02-15-58 (1).jpg>)

**Private Channels** are closed channels. They are visible only to their members. Use private channels for subjects that are sensitive, confidential, or limited to a small group of team members.

Private channels are joined through invitation only. The administrator sets the permissions that determine who can invite others to the channel. By default, only administrators, room owners, and moderators can invite others to private rooms.
