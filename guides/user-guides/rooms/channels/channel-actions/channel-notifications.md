# Channel Notifications

You can change the behavior of notifications for channels where you are a member. By default, a channel notifies you whenever someone mentions you or uses the `@all` mention.

These options are on the **Channel** **Notifications** tab:

* **Disable Notifications**: Disable all notifications for the channel.
* **Audio**: Select whether the channel will emit a sound whenever someone mentions you or posts a message in the channel. The sound played can be customized.
* **Desktop**: Controls notification behavior when using any desktop app or browser.
* **Mobile**: Controls push notification behavior when using any mobile app.
* **Email**: Set whether an email sends whenever someone mentions you or posts a message, or disable email notifications.
* **Unread Room Status**: Control whether the channel on the channel list highlights when there is a new message or mention.
* **Unread Tray Icon**: Controls whether the tray icon highlights new messages or mentions on the current channel.
