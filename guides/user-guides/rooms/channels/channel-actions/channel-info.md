# Channel Information

Here you can see all kinds of information about the current channel. If you have admin permissions, you can edit the information. These are the channel information options:

* **Channel Name**: The channel's name, how users see the title and find the channel via search.
* **Topic**: The topic shows next to the title on the channel header. Great for giving more info about the channel.
* **Announcement**: Announcements post in a bar under the channel header.
* **Description**: The description of the channel.
* **Private**: Tells whether a channel is private and can set the channel to private or public.
* **Read Only**: Tells whether a channel is read-only and toggles the read-only status on the channel. In read-only channels, only people with admin permissions can post messages. Good for announcements channels.
* **Archived**: Tells if a channel is archived and toggles the archived status of a channel. Nobody can post messages in an archived channel, and a channel search will not find that channel.
* **Password**: Tells whether a channel has a password and lets you set the password. If a channel has a password, other users need to enter the password to become a channel's member.

If a [Retention Policy](../../../../administration/admin-panel/settings/retention-policies.md) is active on this channel, a red warning box appears stating when messages or files are deleted.
