# Streaming in a Channel

## Streaming

If the feature [Youtube Livestream](../../../../administration/admin-panel/settings/youtube-broadcasting.md) is enabled, the **Streaming** tab activates on the **Channel** **Actions** menu.

Through the **Streaming** tab, owners of the channel of server admins can start streaming or add another stream to the channel using a URL.

### Start a stream

_Note: Depending on the settings of the server, you might be only able to link live streams from Youtube. In doubt, always ask your server's admin._

1. Press the **Broadcast my Camera** button.
2. Login with a Google account. Remember that streaming must be activated through your Youtube account. For more information, see [Introduction to live streaming](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2474026?hl=en) Google guide).

To add a different Livestream, get the URL (must be from Youtube) for the stream, enter it into the **Livestream source** field, and hit save.

You can also add a message whenever the stream is unavailable in the **Livestream not available message** field.

To add a stream with no video and only audio, use the **Enable audio-only button**.

### Users - Start a Live Stream

If you are not a channel owner and there is already a live stream set to that channel, press **play** on the stream tab. This starts a pop-up with the stream embedded. The pop-up does not close even if you change channels.
