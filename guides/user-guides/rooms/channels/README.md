# Channels

## Types of Channels

There are two types of channels: public and private channels.

### Public channels

Public channels are **open for all members of a Rocket.Chat workspace** to join, and anything posted is searchable by all members. They are identified by: ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2021-12-23\_19-51-58.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
When a user is mentioned on a thread inside a public channel, they are automatically added to the channel.
{% endhint %}

### Private Channels

Private channels are by **invitation only** and are normally used for conversations that are not open to all members. They are identified by: ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/2021-12-23\_19-50-54.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
People must be added/invited to a private channel by someone who's already a member
{% endhint %}

## Listing Channels

Find public and private channels that you are watching in the left sidebar under the **Channels** sections.

Public channels appear first above private channels below them and are alphabetically ordered.

## Joining new channels and starting direct messages

There are three ways of joining a public channel; through search, invites, or mentions.

For starting a direct message, you can either search the user you want to talk or click on that user's avatar and click on the **Conversation Button**.

To search for channels and users, use the search bar under your account box. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl/Cmd + k to access the search bar quickly.

A search will find channels (including the ones you are part of) and users. You can not search inside private channels.

When you click on a search result, the following can happen:

* If the result is a channel, and you already aren't part of it, you will join that channel;
* If the result is a user, you will start a direct message with that user;

## Leaving channels

There are two options for leaving a channel:

1. **Hide:** Remain a member of the channel but remove it from your list of channels on the left-hand pane.
2. **Leave:** Remove the channel from your list of channels and abdicate membership.

Every channel has an **owner**, and the owner of a channel cannot leave a channel until setting someone else as the owner of that channel.

To leave a channel, enter the command `/part` or `/leave` in the message window. Alternatively, hover your mouse over the channel in the list of channels on the left-hand side and click on the **leave channel** button.

To hide a channel, hover your mouse over the channel in the list of channels on the left-hand side and click on the **hide channel** button.
