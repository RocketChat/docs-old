# Block User in Direct Message

You can block any user from sending you direct messages.

To block a user:

* Open up the direct message you have with them if it exists or [initiate the creation](../create-a-new-direct-message-1-1.md) of one and open up the [user info](view-user-info.md) section.
* Then click on **Block**

{% hint style="danger" %}
Blocked users will not be able to send you direct messages unless they are unblocked.
{% endhint %}

After blocking a user, the room will indicate blocked too.
