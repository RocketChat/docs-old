# Mark Discussion as Favorite

To help organize or prioritize your communications, you can **favorite** (or **star**) a discussion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Favoriting a discussion moves it to a **Favorites** section on the channels list, making it easier to access and find.
{% endhint %}

To favorite a discussion, you can:

* Click the **star** icon to the left of the discussion header while it is open.
