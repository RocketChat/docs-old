  larger topics in a team or channel.

# Discussions

Discussions are identified by the discussion symbol:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (635) (1).png>)

On the **Navigation** menu, discussions can be seen under the heading **Discussions** and every discussion is marked with the symbol above:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (670) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
Use discussions to tackle down all specific topics related conversations.
{% endhint %}

Say for example you have a team named **Engineering-Team**, and you created a channel under the engineering team named **Website-Development-Channel.** It makes sense to break down conversation about each feature of the site to discussions for example **Website-Responsiveness-Discussion** where all the talk about the website's responsiveness is done.

Another use case for creating discussions directly in a team for example is: Say we need to talk about arrangements for the engineering teams meeting, we can create an **Engineering-Meeting-Preparation** discussion tied directly to the engineering team.
