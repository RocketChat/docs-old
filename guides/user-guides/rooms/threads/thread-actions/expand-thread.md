# Expand Thread

Since threads appear by the site of any room it was created in, you can expand the thread to occupy much space.

To expand a thread, click on the **expand icon** on the thread's header

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (650) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

## Collapse a Thread

When a thread has been expanded, you can click back on the same icon to collapse.

![](<../../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (653) (1).png>)
