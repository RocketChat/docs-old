# Threads

One of the downfalls of chat systems is that if you have a channel with a lot of people in it, or if a conversation suddenly takes off, it becomes very difficult to keep up with everything that’s going on. That’s where **Threads** come in. It’s almost like organizing your chats into folders - instead of having every single message come in one under the other, you can click and reply to individual messages so that it opens up a different view just for that conversation.

Threads are identified following the threads symbol
