{% hint style="info" %}
Canned responses allow you to save message snippets that you can call with shortcuts (preceded with `!`) to communicate a quick note to your visitors in Omnichannel and for messaging in regular conversations inside your Rocket.Chat's workspace.
{% endhint %}

If you are using canned responses for the first time, please check the Rocket.Chat Admin's guide for canned responses or contact your workspace Administrator to enable canned responses on your workspace.

## Create Canned Responses

To create Canned Responses, follow these steps

* Go to **Administration  > Omnichannel > Canned Responses**. A list of Canned Responses can be seen if they exist
* Click on **+ New**
* A page opens up with details to fill:
  * **Shortcut**: The shortcut of your new canned response.
  * **Message**: Enter your message using any placeholders available. You can also preview the message at any time by switching between the `Editor` and `Preview` tab.
  * **Tags**: Set the tags for your canned response. This helps agents find canned responses specific to a particular topic
  * **Sharing**: Lets you set the usage level of your Canned Response
    * **Public**: Anyone across your workspace can access your canned response.
    * **Department**: Anyone in the selected department can access your canned response.
    * **Private**: Only you and Omnichannel managers can access your canned response.
* Hit **Save** and our new Canned Response is ready to be used by typing `!` in the message box

## Filtering Canned Responses

1. **Search**: Searching the Canned Message shortcut or message text.
2. **Sharing**: You can filter by sharing.
3. **Created By**: You can filter by name of the user who created the canned responses.
