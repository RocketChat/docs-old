# Agents

Omnichannel **** Agents are responsible for handling conversations. An agent can belong to a particular department and they get notified when a conversation gets initiated and they are `available`.

To access this menu, go to **Avatar Menu  > Omnichannel > Agents**. Here, you can **view**, **add** or **remove** agents.

Settings appear, as shown below:

![Omnichannel Agents Panel](<../../.gitbook/assets/Omnichannel Agents Panel>)
