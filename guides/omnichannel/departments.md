# Departments

An Omnichannel Department is a collection of rooms that can be configured based on a category as needed. These departments can be related directly to the various departments in your company.

When set, [Live Chat](livechat-widget-installation.md)conversations can be directed to a specific department.

{% hint style="info" %}
A typical use case is when you have Live Chat conversations being initiated from different places or pages of your website and you need them to be handled by different departments or groups of knowledge experts.

See this section on how to [assign an agent to a department](agents.md#assign-omnichannel-agent-to-a-department).
