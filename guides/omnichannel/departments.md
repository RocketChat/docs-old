# Departments

If you want the omnichannel conversations to be directed to different departments, you can set the departments up in your enterprise Rocket.Chat workspace. For example, you may have livechats coming from various pages of your website, and you might want them to be handled by respective departments.

To access **Departments** settings:

1. Go to the dots menu and hit **Omnichannel**. Omnichannel settings will open up.

* One department: all incoming chats will be offered to agents **only** on that department using a round-robin rule.
* More than one department: the visitor will have to choose what department he wants to talk to at registration.
