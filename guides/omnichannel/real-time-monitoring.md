# Real-time Monitoring

Real-time monitoring allows you to monitor your incoming and ongoing Live Chat conversations in real-time.

To access the Omnichannel Real-time monitoring dashboard, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Real-time Monitoring**.

These monitoring metrics can be filtered as per the **department** and set to be updated in a specified amount of time by changing the **Update every** field.

When a [Live Chat](livechat-widget-installation.md) conversation is initiated, it immediately gets reflected on the monitoring dashboard in real-time.
