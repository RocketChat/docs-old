# Extending Trial

For whatever reason you may need your Enterprise Edition trial to be extended, you can apply for an extension straight from your cloud portal.

Go to your [Cloud Portal](https://cloud.rocket.chat/home) **Workspace** where all your connected instances are listed.

From here, you can apply for an extension by following the steps below.

1. From your cloud portal workspace, click on the kebab menu by the extreme right on the workspace you want to extend its trial.
2. Then select the **Trial Extension** option on the dropdown that appears.
