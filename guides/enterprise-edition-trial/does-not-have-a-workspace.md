# Do not have a Workspace

If you do not have a workspace yet, you will need to deploy one first before applying the Enterprise Edition Trial.

If you already have a workspace, see this [guide](has-workspace.md) on how to apply enterprise trial&#x20;

## Getting your workspace setup

This guide proceeds with [creating a new account](https://cloud.rocket.chat/trial/ee):

* Check your inbox for a link to create a workspace and apply the trial. Click or copy-paste the link in your browser to continue.

* You are then redirected to [Rocket.Chat Cloud Portal](https://cloud.rocket.chat/). Since you don't have any workspace registered yet, the Workspaces section will be empty and you will have the following options:

1. **Install Rocket.Chat**: You can follow our guides on [installing your own Rocket.Chat instance](../../quick-start/deploying-rocket.chat/).
2. **Launch a SaaS Trial**: This is the fastest option to deploy a Rocket.Chat workspace.
3. **Register self-managed**: This lets you register your workspace if you have a workspace up and running.

Following item 1 above, you will see the option to register your server after deploying it as follows:

Now that you have registered your workspace proceed to [Rocket.Chat Cloud Portal](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) to activate the license on the workspace. See the following steps:

1. Under the Workspaces section click on the Apply button at the extreme right.
2. Then click on **Apply Trial** to confirm the action.

## Verify Active Workspace

* When all this is done, refresh the page, and you're able to see your workspace listed with current plan as **Enterprise** with an **Active** status.
