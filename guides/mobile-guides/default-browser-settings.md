# Default Browser Settings

On your mobile, you can now change the behavior to open links.&#x20;

You can set it for the links to be opened on Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Safari, In-App, etc., depending on the apps installed on your device.&#x20;

### **Android**

To access this setting, Click on your **Profile,** and then select **Setting** > **Default** **Browser**.&#x20;

You can choose the default browser where you want links to be opened.  The default options are: In-app and Browser.

* **In-app:**  This setting will open the links by default on in-app browser**.**

* **Browser:**  This setting will open a list of all the browsers (Chrome, Safari) you have installed on your device.

Once you do this, if you open a link through your Rocket.Chat mobile app, it will open through the browser you have installed on your device instead of your default mobile browser.

### **iOS**

If you set your default browser to Safari, it will trigger the deep link from the OS and open the app, if available.
