# Logo

The logo is one of the main resources to identify Rocket.Chat. So, using it consistently and coherent is fundamental to strengthening the brand image.

Our vertical variant should only be used in situations where the full logo won't fit, but our brand name must still be displayed.

### Protection area

The proximity to other elements can reduce the visual impact of the logo. When applying any of the versions, an area of non-interference around the logo must be protected, equivalent to at least 3 balls from our symbol.

### Position in icons

Whenever placing the Rocket.Chat symbol in circular or square formats, use the circle in the center of our symbol as a reference for centering.
