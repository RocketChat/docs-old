# Air-gapped workspace Configuration

This section seeks to handle some extra configurations that can be done on your air-gapped workspace.

## Push Notification Configuration

To configure push notifications on your workspace, you can use the Rocket.Chat push notification gateway following this guide&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../guides/mobile-guides/push-notifications/" %}
[push-notifications](../guides/mobile-guides/push-notifications/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

This requires you to have your workspace registered as explained here

{% content-ref url="offline-workspace-registration.md" %}
[offline-workspace-registration.md](offline-workspace-registration.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For fully air-gapped workspaces, you have build a Rocket.Chat app for your desired mechanism. [https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine)
{% endhint %}
