### Quick start for code developers

Prerequisites:

- Git
- Meteor
- Now just clone and start the app:

```
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git
cd Rocket.Chat
meteor
```

If you are not a developer and just want to run the server - see [deployment methods](/3.%20Installation/2.%20PaaS%20Deployments).
