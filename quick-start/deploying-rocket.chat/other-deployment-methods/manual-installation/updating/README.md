# Updating

Usually you can update Rocket.Chat server pretty easily.

Stop Rocket.Chat service:

```
sudo systemctl stop rocketchat
```

Remove the installation folder, usually in /opt:

```
sudo rm -rf /opt/Rocket.Chat
```

Make sure you have the needed build packages Debian

```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential graphicsmagick
```

Centos

```
sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make
```

Update the node version required by Rocket.Chat:

{% hint style="info" %}
As from Rocket.Chat `V4`, node version migrated from `12.x.x` to `14.x.x`
{% endhint %}

```
sudo n install 14.0.0
```

Download Rocket.Chat latest version:

```
curl -L https://releases.rocket.chat/latest/download -o /tmp/rocket.chat.tgz
```

```
tar -xzf /tmp/rocket.chat.tgz -C /tmp
```

Install it and set right permissions to Rocket.Chat folder:

```
cd /tmp/bundle/programs/server && npm install
```

```
sudo mv /tmp/bundle /opt/Rocket.Chat
```

```
sudo chown -R rocketchat:rocketchat /opt/Rocket.Chat
```

Start the service:

```
sudo systemctl start rocketchat
```

## Caveats on upgrading your standalone Rocket.Chat database

### Replicasets

Any version after v1.0.x requires replicasets/oplogging enabled on Mongo.

eg. [https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/manual-installation/mongo-replicas](https://rocket.chat/docs/installation/manual-installation/mongo-replicas)

### Upgrading the database

Due to Mongo DB schema changes between versions it is recommended to upgrade your database one Rocket.Chat version at a time to avoid database issues.

Do _not_ backup from one version and try to restore to another eg:

You have Rocket.Chat 0.65.x

Do not try to backup the database and restore to direct to another version e.g. Rocket.Chat 1.2.x

Follow this procedure:

* Backup DB -> \~/Rocket/Backup/v0.65
* Upgrade Rocket one version eg 0.65.x -> 0.66.x
* Check for errors
* Backup DB -> \~/Rocket/Backup/v0.66
* Upgrade Rocket one version eg 0.66.x -> 0.67.x
* Check for errors - if you discover any, stop and fix them or go back to the previous version and start again
* Repeat

(this is a very good reason to keep reasonably up to date with Rocket.Chat versions)
