# Rapid Deployment Methods

Whether you are a newbie, developer, or nontechnical person, Rocket.Chat offers a variety of deployment methods you can get started with regardless of the platform you intend to use.

{% hint style="info" %}
Our personal favorite and recommended choice is to use [Docker and Docker Compose](docker-and-docker-compose/)
{% endhint %}

Before we dive into deployment, make sure you meet the [hardware-requirements.md](../hardware-requirements.md "mention")

Some of our most popular and simple deployment methods are

{% content-ref url="docker-and-docker-compose/" %}
[docker-and-docker-compose](docker-and-docker-compose/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="snaps/" %}
[snaps](snaps/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="rocketchatctl.md" %}
[rocketchatctl.md](rocketchatctl.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
