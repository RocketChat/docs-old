# Inviting Users

After creating and setting up your new workspace, it is time to start using Rocket.Chat.

You can start by creating your first user following this guide on [adding new users](../../guides/administration/admin-panel/users/add-new-users.md) or[ inviting your friends and colleagues to join your server](../../guides/administration/admin-panel/users/invite-users-to-your-rocket.chat-workspace.md)

Note that for self-managed instances you need to have[ SMTP enabled and configured](../../guides/administration/settings/email/setup.md) in order to be able to send emails through the workspace.
{% endhint %}
