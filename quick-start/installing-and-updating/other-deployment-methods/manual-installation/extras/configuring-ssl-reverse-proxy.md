# Configuring SSL Reverse Proxy

Rocket.Chat is a middle tier application server, by itself it does not handle SSL. However, Rocket.Chat works well with several industrial grade, battle-tested reverse proxy servers (see nginx below, for example) that you can configure to handle SSL.

**Note:** You must use the outside https address for the value at `ROOT_URL` in \[\[Section 3|Deploy-Rocket.Chat-without-docker#3-download-rocketchat]] above. This includes the `https://` and leave off the port number. So instead of `ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000` use something like `https://your_hostname.com`

**Note:** When setting up a reverse proxy in front of your Rocket.Chat server you need to configure Rocket.Chat to use the correct clientAddress. The rate limiter (and maybe other features) will not work properly if this is not done. Set `HTTP_FORWARDED_COUNT` Environment variable to the correct number of proxies in front of Rocket.Chat. If you are using snap there's a documentation how to do it [here](https://docs.rocket.chat/installation/manual-installation/ubuntu/snaps/#how-do-i-change-other-environmental-variables-in-my-snap)

## Running behind a nginx SSL Reverse Proxy

**Note:** These instructions were written for Ubuntu. For Amazon Linux, the conf file for the proxy goes in `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` and needs to have a discrete name ending in `.conf` and nginx is installed using `yum -y install nginx`.

Run this as root:

```
apt-get install nginx
```

Add your private key to `/etc/nginx/certificate.key`

Lock down permissions: `chmod 400 /etc/nginx/certificate.key`

Add your certificate to `/etc/nginx/certificate.crt`

Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` or if you use nginx from docker `/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` and be sure to use your actual hostname in lieu of the sample hostname "your\_hostname.com" below.

```
# Upstreams
upstream backend {
    server 127.0.0.1:3000;
}

# HTTPS Server
server {
    listen 443;
    server_name your_hostname.com;

    # You can increase the limit if your need to.
    client_max_body_size 200M;

    error_log /var/log/nginx/rocketchat.access.log;

    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certificate.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; # donâ€™t use SSLv3 ref: POODLE

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;

        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;

        proxy_redirect off;
    }
}
```

Restart Nginx: `service nginx restart`

## Running under Plesk Onyx behind Nginx

Plesk Onyx has now a docker installation and Nginx proxy docker rule generator built in, that doesn't support adding custom directives. Disable it and add the rules manually in the additional Nginx directives space. A scheme follows (replace 30000 with your external docker mapped port).

```
#manual extension docker with socket upgrade begin
location ~ ^/.* {
    proxy_pass http://0.0.0.0:3000;
    proxy_set_header Host             $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP        $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For  $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto http;
    proxy_set_header X-Nginx-Proxy true;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;

    proxy_redirect off;
}

#extension docker end
```

## Running behind an Apache SSL Reverse Proxy

**Note:** You must use the outside https address for the value at `ROOT_URL` in \[\[Section 3|Deploy-Rocket.Chat-without-docker#3-download-rocketchat]] above. This includes the `https://` and leave off the port number. So instead of `ROOT_URL=http://localhost:3000` use something like `https://your_hostname.com`

Run this as root:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2
a2enmod proxy_http
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod ssl
a2enmod proxy_wstunnel
a2enmod rewrite
```

Add your private key to `/etc/ssl/private/chat.domain.com.key`

Lock down permissions: `chmod 400 /etc/ssl/private/chat.domain.com.key`

Add your certificate to `/etc/ssl/certs/chat.domain.com.crt`

Add your intermediate to `/etc/ssl/certs/intermediate.ca.pem`

Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/rocketchat.conf` and be sure to use your actual hostname in lieu of the sample hostname "your\_hostname.com" below.

```
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerAdmin it@domain.com
    ServerName chat.domain.com

    LogLevel info
    ErrorLog /var/log/chat.domain.com_error.log
    TransferLog /var/log/chat.domain.com_access.log

    SSLEngine On
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/chat.domain.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/chat.domain.com.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/ssl/certs/intermediate.ca.pem

    <Location />
        Require all granted
    </Location>

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:CONNECTION} Upgrade [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} =websocket [NC]
    RewriteRule /(.*)           ws://localhost:3000/$1 [P,L]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} !=websocket [NC]
    RewriteRule /(.*)           http://localhost:3000/$1 [P,L]

    ProxyPassReverse /          http://localhost:3000/
</VirtualHost>
```

Restart Apache: `service apache2 restart`

## Running behind a Caddy Reverse Proxy with Free SSL

First, download [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com)

`curl https://getcaddy.com | bash`

Now Caddy is installed, but you still need a service to run Caddy http server on the background.

You can find services backed by the community [here](https://github.com/mholt/caddy/tree/master/dist/init)

You must have at least the port **443** opened so the Caddy server will request an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt

You can also open the port 80 to redirect http requests to https.

Open `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

Insert

```
yourdomain.com {
        reverse_proxy localhost:3000
        header Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST, GET, OPTIONS"
        header Access-Control-Allow-Headers "*"
        import cors https://sub.domain.livechat
}
```
