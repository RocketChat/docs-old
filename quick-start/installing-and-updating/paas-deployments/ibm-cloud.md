# IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud have various options for hosting Rocket.Chat, Docker container on a Kubernetes cluster, VMWare, Bare Metal Server, but the instructions below will focus in creating a Cloud Foundry Rocket.Chat app.

## Prerequisites

* An IBM Cloud account
* The IBM Cloud command line client (ibmcloud) installed
* git

## Deploying Rocket.Chat

First, logon to the [IBM Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/) and then select in the Apps box, `Create an app`.

Then give the Rocket.Chat server a unique app name, select as `Starting point`&#x20;

Create a new app, and as `Platform` select Node.js. Finish by clicking `Create`.

After creation is finished, select `Create service` from the App Details tab, select Databases from the list of services, and Databases for MongoDB.

Configure MongoDB to enable oplog tailing and intiate a replicaset.

All remaining steps will be preformed at the command line.

Git clone the latest Rocket.Chat:

```
git clone https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.git
```

Log in to the IBM Cloud command-line interface:

```
ibmcloud cf login
```

Push Rocket.Chat to the app you created early in the dashboard using meteor-buildpack-horse:

```
cf push <your app name> -m 512M -b https://github.com/RocketChat/meteor-buildpack-horse.git
```

Go to `https://<your app name>.mybluemix.net/` in your browser to access your instance of Rocket.Chat
