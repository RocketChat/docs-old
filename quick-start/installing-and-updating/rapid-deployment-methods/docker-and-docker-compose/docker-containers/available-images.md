# Available Images



Rocket.Chat is a rapidly-moving FOSS project. We maintain 3 Docker images for the diverse needs of our global user community. To use these images you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed and operational.

Discovering existing releases: You can select the release you need from our [GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases). Here's a description of our [current branching strategy](https://developer.rocket.chat/rocket.chat/contribute-to-rocket.chat/development-workflow).
