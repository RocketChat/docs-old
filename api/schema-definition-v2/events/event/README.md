  The event is the former message, but way more flexible, allowing us to use it
  for different goals. Currently, we only use it for messages and some room
  events.

# IEvent

### Interface Definition

```typescript
interface IEvent<T extends EDataDefinition> {
	_id: string;
	clid?: string;
	pids: Array<string>;
	v: number;
	ts: Date;
	src: string;
	ct: EventContext;
	cid: string;
	t: EventTypeDescriptor;
	dHash: string;
	o: T;
	d: T;
	isLeaf?: boolean;
	deletedAt?: Date;
}
```

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| \_id | The event id, which is a SHA256 hash of the `src`, `ct`, `cid`, `_pids`, `t`, `ts` and `dHash` |
| clid | This is the "id generated by the client", on V1 our clients generate the `_id` of the message, so this needs to be here for backward compatibility |
| pids | The ids of the previous events |
| v | The version of the schema |
| src | The source of this event, which server, this will be used to federate events later on |
| ct | This is part of the context, holds the type of the context \(for example, "room"\), more in [EventContext](../eventcontext.md) |
| cid | This is also part of the context, holds the of the context \(like the room id\) |
| t | The type of the event, details in [EventTypeDescriptor](event-type-descriptor.md) |
| dHash | The hash of some or all of the properties on `d`, depending on the event type |
| o | The event's data when it was created, this never changes and it is used to calcute the hash when a integrity verification is realized |
| d | The event's data, the payload, details in [EventDataDefinition](event-data-definition/), this can change when and event is updated using [IEventDataUpdate](event-data-definition/i-event-data-update.md) |
| isLeaf | This will on appear when it is set to true and determines wheter or not this is the latest item of a chain, the leaf of the tree. More than one event may have the `isLeaf` flagged as true in the same context |
| deletedAt | The date that this event was deleted |

Example of types "room" and "msg":
