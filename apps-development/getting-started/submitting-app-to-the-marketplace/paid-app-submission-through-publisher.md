It is a one-off payment and you are allowed to use it forever.

You are allowed to buy the app per workspace. If you have two workspaces and want to use the app on both, you need to buy the app separately.

If it is a subscription-based app, select the **Purchase Type: Subscription** and set up your plan **tier** wise. It allows you to pay a flat fee according to your unit. An example of this volume-based pricing is shown below:
