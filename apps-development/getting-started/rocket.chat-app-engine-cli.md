# Rocket.Chat App Engine CLI

Our official Apps Engine [Command Line Interface \(CLI\)](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Apps-cli) is available on GitHub and published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rocket.chat/apps-cli). It provides an easy interface for developing extensions. Follow the quick steps below to create your first application.

## Installation

Before installing the CLI make sure that you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) already installed on your machine. To verify Node installation, use the following command in your terminal.

```bash
node -v
# v10.15.3
# It should return you a valid version.
```

Once you have installed Node, run the following command in your terminal to install the CLI globally.

```bash
npm install -g @rocket.chat/apps-cli
```

It will take a while to install the CLI depending upon your internet connection. After installation, run the following command to verify the installation.

```bash
rc-apps -v
# @rocket.chat/apps-cli/1.4.0 darwin-x64 node-v10.15.3
```

Note that the response may vary depending upon your machine and environment, but it should look similar. Now, you are all set to create your first app.
