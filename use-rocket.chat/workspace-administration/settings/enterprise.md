# Enterprise

Use this setting to update your enterprise license manually. See this section on how to get [Enterprise License](../../../setup-and-administer-rocket.chat/enterprise-edition-trial/).

{% hint style="info" %}
If your workspace is registered and the license is provided by Rocket.Chat Cloud, you don't need to update the license here manually.
{% endhint %}

To access this menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Enterprise**.

* **Enterprise License**: A field to enter your enterprise license.
* **Status**: This shows the current status of your applied license, whether it is valid or invalid.

When all your changes are done, hit the **Save changes** button to commit it.
