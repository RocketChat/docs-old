# Device management settings

To access this setting,

* Navigate to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Device management**
* **Enable login detection emails**: When enabled, emails are sent to workspace members each time new logins are detected on their accounts.
* **Allow workspace members to turn off login detection emails**: When enabled, individual members can set their preferences. It is useful when frequent login expirations are set, causing members to log in frequently.
