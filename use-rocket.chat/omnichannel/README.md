# Omnichannel

Rocket.Chat **Omnichannel** allows you to integrate various customer communication channels into your workspace. You can incorporate the [Omnichannel Live Chat pop-up](livechat-widget-installation.md) widget into your website, serving as an entry point for communication or direct support to your customers or visitors.&#x20;

You can also use advanced [Omnichannel Apps](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/), which provide a seamless communication experience between Rocket.Chat and external users from other communication platforms like [WhatsApp](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/whatsapp/), [SMS](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/sms.md), [Facebook](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/facebook-app/), [Instagram Direct](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/instagram-direct/), [Twitter](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/twitter-app/twitter-app-installation.md), [Telegram](../../extend-rocket.chat-capabilities/rocket.chat-marketplace/rocket.chat-public-apps-guides/omnichannel-apps/telegram-app/), etc.&#x20;
