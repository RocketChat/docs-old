As a Rocket.Chat workspace admin, you can enable and disable Canned Responses on your server

## Enable Rocket.Chat Canned Responses

To enable canned responses on your workspace:

* Go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Settings** > **Omnichannel** > **Canned Responses**
* Activate the toggle to enable and **Save Changes**

{% hint style="info" %}
* When Canned Responses is enabled, it'll be available to users with the corresponding `*-canned-responses` role.
* To enable **Canned Responses** for the first time, **Omnichannel** needs to be enabled first.
* **Canned Responses** can be used only in the normal workspace when Omnichannel is disabled.
{% endhint %}

## Canned Responses Permissions

Under the **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Permissions** section, you can define which user roles should be able to view, create and delete the canned responses.

Check the Omnichannel manager's guide for canned responses to save a new canned response for your workspace.
