Omnichannel Priorities enables you to change the order of Omnichannel queues based on `Estimated Due Time`.

Conversations associated with priorities will be sorted in the order of estimated due time from a shorter to a longer time. This means chats with a shorter due time(high priority) will appear in the queue before others with either longer or no due time set(low priority).

{% hint style="info" %}
`Estimated Due Time` is an estimated time defined for a customer to be served. If the estimated due time is, for instance, 10 minutes, the customer is supposed to wait in queue for up to 10 minutes until an agent takes the chat.
{% endhint %}

To access **Priorities** settings,

* Go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Priorities**.

## List Omnichannel Priorities

On the Priorities main menu, a list of all priorities is seen if any exists. Clicking on any opens a panel to edit it.

Each Priority has its own(unique) `Estimated due time`(time in minutes), so once a priority is associated with an `Inquiry/room`, this value is used to set the [queue ](../omnichannel-agents-guides/omnichannel-queue.md)inquiry order. Priority is not mandatory for each conversation. Thus, the Omnichannel queues will have conversations with and without priorities.
