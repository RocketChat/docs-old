# Cloud Account Setup Wizard

The Cloud Setup Wizard guides you through registering your server to receive free push notifications.

After entering your [administrative and organization information during the setup of your Rocket.Chat workspace](../../setup-and-administer-rocket.chat/accessing-your-workspace/rocket.chat-setup-wizard.md#setup-wizard), register your server to the Rocket.Chat Cloud or run it as a standalone service.

Connecting your workplace to the cloud gives you access to interact with services like

* Mobile push notifications gateway
* Live Chat Omnichannel proxy
* OAuth proxy for social network
* Apps Marketplace

To register your server,&#x20;

* Connect it to your cloud account. If you already have one- enter the cloud email address. Otherwise, create a [new account](https://docs.rocket.chat/rocket.chat-saas/cloud-account/create-new-cloud-account).
* You will receive an email to the registered email with a confirmation link. You must verify the security code that matches the one in the email.
* Click **Verify Registration**. Confirm the registration and go back to your server.
* Your workspace is ready. Click **Go to your workspace** to access it.

To continue as a Standalone Server,

* Click **Continue as standalone.**
* Then click **Confirm**. Your workspace is now ready for use.
