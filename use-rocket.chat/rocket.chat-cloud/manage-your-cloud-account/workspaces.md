# Workspaces

As a workspace administrator, you can view and manage all the workspaces linked to your account.

## Manage Workspaces

When you log in, you will see the list of workspaces linked to your cloud account.&#x20;

To register a self-managed workspace, click **Register self-managed** to enable your self-hosted workspace.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;If you want multiple cloud workspaces under the same cloud account, please contact us at [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat).
{% endhint %}

To view workspace Information,

* Click the workspace to see the following workspace information:&#x20;
  * Workspace plan
  * Push notification limit
  * Total usage
  * Push notification usage.

After your first sign-up, you are given a Rocket.Chat Enterprise Edition for 30 days. No payment is required. On the 30th day, you will be charged according to your chosen plan. The minimum volume or resources on Cloud provided per workspace is for 25 members, so you will be billed accordingly even if you have less than 25 users. Workspace members will continue to receive mobile push notifications for the remainder of the trial.&#x20;

## Upgrade/Downgrade your plan

{% endhint %}

## Restart Workspace

When facing issues with your workspace, you can restart your workspace. This process disconnects you from your workspace so that it can be shut down and restarted. A server restart is required when you face minor performance issues, e.g., slow messages. After you restart your workspace, it will take 1-5 minutes (depending upon your number of users) for the workspace to continue again.

To restart your workspace,

* From the sidebar menu, click **Workspaces**
* Select the Workspace and click **Restart your workspace.**

## Cancel Workspace

You can cancel your workspace to end your subscription and hibernate your server.

To cancel a workspace,

* From the sidebar menu, click **Workspaces.**
* Click the **** ![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/three-dot-icon (1).png>)**three-dot** icon beside the workspace.
* Select **Cancel**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware that the workspace administrator in your [Cloud Console](https://cloud.rocket.chat/) is the only person who can end your subscription. Self-managed customers can't cancel their workspaces.
{% endhint %}

When you cancel a Saas service, the status remains **canceling** until the end of your billing cycle. After the billing cycle is ended, the status is changed to **canceled.**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you change your mind within 30 days of your workspace getting canceled, please reach out to us at [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat) to get your workspace restored. After 30 days, you will have to create a new one.
{% endhint %}
