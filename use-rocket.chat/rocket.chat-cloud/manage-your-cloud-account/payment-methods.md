# Payment Methods

You can add your credit or debit card as a new payment method for your Rocket.Chat account. The payment methods will then be an option when you make the payments. You have the option to set a card as your default payment method.

To add a new payment method,

* From the sidebar menu, click **Payment Methods.**&#x20;
* Then, click **Add Payment Method.**
* Add your credit/debit card details. Click **Add Card**.

To delete a card,

* Select the card, and click Delete.

If you have only one credit card added, you can't delete the only payment method on your own. Please get in touch with [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat) to get it deleted.
