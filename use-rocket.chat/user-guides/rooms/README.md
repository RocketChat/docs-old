## Types of Rooms in Rocket.Chat

****[**Channels**](channels/)**:** Organize conversations across different topics.

****[**Teams**](../../../guides/user-guides/rooms/teams/)**:** Promotes collaboration between different teams.

****[**Discussions**](../../workspace-administration/settings/discussion.md):  Allows a separate focused conversation around larger topics in a team or channel.

****[**Direct Messages**](direct-messages/): Allows one-off conversations that do not require a channel or team.

****[**Thread**](../../workspace-administration/settings/threads.md): Organized conversations around a particular message.

## Mentions

When someone mentions you with `@username`, `@all` or `@here`, a symbol or a number will appear alongside the channel name. If someone mentions `@all` or `@here` a number will show up showing the number of times the mention is specific to you.
