# Manage Team Members

Team members must have either one of these roles: Owner, Leader, Moderator, or User. Each team member's [permission](../../../workspace-administration/permissions.md) members will depend on their role. The team owner can manage all the team members and assign any of these roles to them.

## View Team Members

To see the list of members in a Team,&#x20;

* Click the **Team Members** icon at the top-right menu of the team screen.&#x20;
* Select a user to view their **User Info**.
* You can send a direct message or call the user from the user info.&#x20;
* Click the **three dots** icon to see other user actions like ignore, mute user, or set roles ( as moderator, leader, or owner).

## Add Members to Team

You can add members to a team in two ways:&#x20;

* Send an Invite Link
* Manually Adding Users

### Send an Invite Link

At the bottom of the team members page, click **Invite Link** and copy the generated link to send to whomever you invite.

#### Edit Invite Link

Depending on how long you want an invite link to last, you can edit the invite link periodically. &#x20;

* On the Invite Link page, Click **Edit Invite.**
* Select **Expiration (Days)** from the drop-down, select **Max number of uses, and** click **Generate New Link.**

#### Delete Invite Link

\
To delete an invite link, see [Delete an Invite Record via Admin Panel](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/admin-panel/invites#delete-a-record). This feature comes in handy when you have an invite link with an **Expiration date: Never**. To avoid abuse, you can revoke it by deleting the invite record.

### Manually Adding Users

* At the bottom of the Team members page, click **Add.**&#x20;
* Search and select the users, then click **Add users.**&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Rocket.Chat notifies you if the user is already an existing team member**.**
{% endhint %}

## Remove a member from the Team

By default, only the team owner can remove a team member. Although, other users with appropriate permissions can also remove a team member.

* In the Team members screen, search and select the user to view their **User Info**.&#x20;
* Click the **three dots** icon, then select **Remove from team.**
