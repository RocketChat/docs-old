## Prune Messages from a Discussion

If you are a server admin, or your admin has given you the **clean-discussion-history** [permission](../../../workspace-administration/permissions.md), the **prune messages** option allows you to delete messages from a discussion swiftly.

_Pruned messages and files are deleted forever and cannot be recovered. You are advised to use this feature with extra caution._

To prune selected messages, fill in these fields:

* **Newer than**: Deletes all messages posted **after** a particular date.
* **Older than**: Deletes all messages posted **before** a particular date.
* **Users**:  Allows you to specify which user's message to delete. Add a username, and the user's messages are deleted.
* **Inclusive**: Deletes all messages that were sent  at the specified start and end times you have specified in the `Newer than` and `Older than` fields.
* **Exclude pinned messages**: Do **not** delete pinned messages.
