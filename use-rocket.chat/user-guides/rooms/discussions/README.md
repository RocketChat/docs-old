# Discussions

Rocket.Chat discussions allow you to have a separate conversation about larger topics in a [team](../../../../guides/user-guides/rooms/teams/) or [channel](../channels/). Use discussions to address specific topics and their related conversations. They are displayed under the **Discussions** section of the sidebar. They are identified by  ![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/discussion-icon.png).

{% hint style="info" %}
Discussions must belong to a parent [team ](../../../../guides/user-guides/rooms/teams/)or [channel](../channels/).
{% endhint %}

For example, you have an **Engineering-Team** in your workspace and created a channel under that team called **Website-Development-Channel.** Let's break down the conversations about each feature of the website into discussions. Now, you can have a **Website-Landing-Page** discussion where all the conversations about the landing page occur.

## Discussion Information

The room information screen gives detailed information about the current discussion. These details include:

* **Name:** The name of the discussion, how users see the title and find the discussion via search.
* **Description**: The description of the discussion.
* **Announcement**: Announcements post in a bar under the discussion header.
* **Topic**: The topic here is next to the channel header's title. It shows which channel or group the discussion is linked to.
* **Private**: When enabled, makes the discussion private.
* **Read Only**: Tells whether a discussion is read-only and toggles the read-only status on the discussion. In read-only discussions, only people with admin permissions can post messages.
* **Archived**: Enable to archive a discussion. Nobody can post messages in an archived discussion, and searching will not find the discussion.
* **Password**: Tells whether a discussion is protected with a password. The password is required before joining the discussion.
