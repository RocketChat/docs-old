# Email Inboxes Agent Guide

In your Rocket.Chat workspace, you can receive emails from contacts on an email address configured as an [email inbox](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-workspace-administration/email-inboxes).

{% hint style="info" %}
To use this feature, your workspace administrator must enable [Omnichannel ](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administration/settings/omnichannel-admins-guide#enable-omnichannel)and assign [agents](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/omnichannel/agents) and [managers](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/omnichannel/managers). Kindly contact your administrator to set up [email inboxes ](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-workspace-administration/email-inboxes)on your workspace.
{% endhint %}

Once an [email inbox](https://docs.rocket.chat/use-rocket.chat/rocket.chat-workspace-administration/email-inboxes) is set up successfully, any new email received is shown in your Rocket.Chat workspace. You can view and reply to these emails from your workspace. When you reply, it appears like any other email in your contact’s inbox.&#x20;

The Omnichannel menu is available with the **Turn off answer chats** and **Contact Center** options for agents.

## Invite an Agent to an Email Inbox

Suppose you need help with a particular email, you can invite your fellow **agent** to that channel using `/invite @username` .

Once an agent is invited to an email inbox, they have access to all the previous conversations that have taken place there. You can also have internal conversations with your fellow agent on that channel.
