# Conference Call User's Guide

If you are using the conference call feature for the first time on Rocket.Chat, contact your administrator or follow the admin guide linked below to configure conference calling on your Rocket.Chat instance.

{% content-ref url="conference-call-admin-guide/" %}

{% endcontent-ref %}

In Rocket.Chat you can initiate video and audio conferences using your chosen provider in:

1. [Direct call (within _Direct Messages)_](conference-call-users-guide.md#direct-messages)__
2. [Conference call (within _Teams_, _Channels_, _Discussion_, _Multiple Direct Messages_)](conference-call-users-guide.md#conference-call)

### Initiating a call - Direct message

Click on the phone icon to start a conference call from within a direct message conversation, as shown in the highlighted part below:

![Initiating a call - direct messages](<../../.gitbook/assets/Initiating a call - direct messages-Conferenc.png>)

In the next step, you may have pre-flight options like turning on/off the camera or microphone. (But these will be available depending on the conference call provider you have chosen for your workspace.)

After clicking the call button, the pop-up changes to the “calling state”. This enables you to perform other actions while you wait for the receiver to answer. The ringer stays active for 30 seconds.

After confirmation, a call pop-up appears in the top right corner and the ringer starts. This enables you to perform other actions while you wait for the receiver to answer. The ringer stays active for 30s. After that **Call again** button appears in the channel.  &#x20;

### Incoming direct call

Three things happen once you receive a call:

* A pop-up appears wherever you are in the Rocket.Chat application.&#x20;
* The incoming call ringer starts to ring.&#x20;
* An incoming call item will be highlighted in the left sidebar.

And three actions are possible in this situation:

* Accept and join the call room
* Decline: giving the other user feedback through the chat
* Dismiss: silently ignoring the call.

## Start a call - Room

Click on the phone icon to start a conference call from within a Team, Channel, Discussion, and Multiple Direct Messages.

In the next step, you may have pre-flight options like turning on/off the camera or microphone. (But these will be available depending on the conference call provider you have chosen for your workspace.)

![Call initiation - room](<../../.gitbook/assets/Call initiation - room- conference call.png>)

After clicking on the call button, a message will be sent in the room, where call participants will be shown as thumbnails.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}

### Video conference logs

After a conference is ended, the room keeps a record of:

* the user who initiated it
* the start time
* name of the conference and,
* attendees&#x20;

The video conference contextual bar keeps all conferences that happened on a channel organized.&#x20;
