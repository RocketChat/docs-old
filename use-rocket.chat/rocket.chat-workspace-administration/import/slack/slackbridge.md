# SlackBridge

SlackBridge allows you to mirror the messages received in a Slack channel or private group into Rocket.Chat in real-time.

To enable it, you have to create a Custom Bot in Slack and add it to the desired channels / private groups. Once enabled and added to rooms, SlackBridge will clone the room in Rocket.Chat and also clone users that speak in that room.

## To create a Custom Bot in Slack:

1. Got to ["Set up a bot user"](https://my.slack.com/apps/A0F7YS25R-bots)
2. Click "Add Configuration"
3. Pick a username for your Bot and click **Add Bot Integration**
4. Copy the API Token. You'll need it when setting up SlackBridge in Rocket.Chat
5. Customize your bot the way you like it and click on Save Integration

## To enable SlackBridge in Rocket.Chat:

1. Go to `https://[your_host]/admin/SlackBridge`
2. Enable SlackBridge
3. Add your API Token, copied in step 4 above
4. Restart your Rocket.Chat server

When done, you can now invite/add the bot to the channel or private group you want to mirror from
