# Matrix Bridge

Rocket.Chat Matrix Bridge is made possible through the [Matrix](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction#what-is-matrix) protocol, an open standard for decentralized communication over the internet.

It is designed to provide secure, interoperable, and decentralized real-time communication between Rocket.Chat and any Matrix-compatible applications or servers seamlessly.

Using the Rocket.Chat Matrix Bridge integration requires you to have a [Matrix homeserver](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/introduction#how-does-it-work) available. We recommend [Synapse](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/), which is the most stable as compared to other versions like [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Matrix Bridge feature has been verified with Synapse `v1.71.0`.
