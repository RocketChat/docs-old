# Communicate with a federated user

After you have configured everything and created some federated channels, you're now able to:

* Send and receive messages.
* Send and receive messages with emojis.
* Send and receive attachments (Files, audio messages, and video messages).
* Quote messages.
* React to messages.
* Edit Messages.
* Delete Messages (only your own messages).
* Mention internal and external users inside any federated room.
* Send and receive users' typing indicator ([More info](../matrix-admin-guide/matrix-homeserver-setup/#important-warning-about-the-installation)).

There are also some features not directly related to rooms:

* Users' avatar synchronization.
* Search for public rooms in any external home server inside the Matrix Network (_coming soon_).
* Servers' allow list/block list(_coming soon_).
