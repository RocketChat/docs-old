# Rocket.Chat Privacy Policy

_Effective date: October 23rd, 2020_

Rocket.Chat Technologies Corp. ("us", "we", or "our") operates the [https://rocket.chat](https://rocket.chat) website, the [https://open.rocket.chat](https://open.rocket.chat) community server, the Marketplace, incl. associated Rocket.Chat Apps, Rocket.Chat´s Cloud Offering and the Rocket.Chat mobile applications (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions.

## Summary

*   **Administrators are responsible for user privacy, we help administrators**

    There are basically two ways of using Rocket.Chat: self-managed (also known as on-premises deployment) on your own or someone else´s infrastructure or via our hosted offering. In both cases, the administrator of that instance - or the organization behind the administrator - is the person responsible to ensure privacy of Rocket.Chat users. We aim to help by providing features in our products and services to make that job easier. We also provide this policy to explain what we do as a "helping hand"/data processor for administrators in case we process personal data of users.
*   **You remain in control of your personal data**

    We cannot access your personal data in a self-managed instance of Rocket.Chat. Our code is open source, there are no back doors whatsoever. You are however free to connect a self-managed instance to other services, e.g. our marketplace or push notification gateway, where this privacy policy applies. When you do not register your instance, these settings are turned off by default. You can also connect it to third party services, such as external authentication services, in which case their privacy policy applies. It is your choice and you are not forced to do so. In our hosted offering, we only process your data for the purposes of providing you the service in the name of the administrator. Administrators are still in full control over the configuration of their instance.
*   **We don´t sell your data**

    We do not sell your personal data. Our business model is to provide you with a free edition and we charge you for extra services or features, according to the plan you choose. What you process within Rocket.Chat is yours and stays yours.
*   **Our community server is for testing purposes**

    Our community server [https://open.rocket.chat](https://open.rocket.chat) is a testing ground for our users and we use it to test and analyze new features. We track user activity in there with the trackers described below - including google analytics - to learn how our service is used and to improve our product.

## **What personal data do we collect and to which purposes do we use your personal data?**

In connection with our operations and during the lifecycle of business relationship with our customers, we collect various types of personal data, meaning any information that identifies or allows to identify you, including:

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Data"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

* Email address
* First name and last name
* Cookies and Usage Data

We may use your Personal Data to contact you with newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, and other information that may be of interest to you, if you have provided consent to this processing or if we can base this processing on a legitimate interest that is not overridden by your fundamental rights. You may in the future withdraw that consent or object to receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we send or by contacting us.

#### Account Data

Some Services may allow or require that you register for a personalized account. Account data may include in addition your account name, authentication information, registration date, contact information, payment information, and any other information associated with your account.

#### Usage Data

We may also collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Service or when you access the Service, incl. by or through a mobile device ("Usage Data").

This Usage Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address), browser type, browser version, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.

When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, this Usage Data may include information such as the type of mobile device you use, the IP address of your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the app version, the type of mobile Internet browser you use, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data.

As a byproduct of the usage data within a Rocket.Chat instance, Administrators may choose to share aggregated and therefore anonymous, non-personal data with us to help us learn more about how our product is being used. This setting is described [here](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administrator-guides/general#reporting). The information shared is the same information as is shown on the "info"-page of the administration panel of an instance. E.g. this statistics sharing would transmit the total # of channels, but it would not transmit the actual channel names, and so on, preserving the privacy of your workspace. This is completely optional to use and can be activated and deactivated at any time.

#### Location Data

We may use and store information about your location if you give us permission to do so (“Location Data”). We use this data to provide features of our Service (only to allow you to share your location to another user via Rocket.Chat, if it was enabled by the administrator).

You can enable or disable location services when you use our Service at any time, through your device settings.

#### App Data

When you use the Marketplace, you may choose to install Apps provided by Rocket.Chat. These Apps process data from your instance of Rocket.Chat and therefore nonpersonal data, such as software version, amount of users, and similar. Depending on the purpose and your actual usage of the App (e.g. enabling certain features), Personal Data may however be processed. E.g. you enable an integration, which processes your users' information. The description of the App will make the types of personal data sufficiently clear as well as any potential deviations from this policy.

For Third-Party Apps on the Marketplace, the Vendor will provide you with a specific privacy policy that governs his Third-Party App.

#### Content you provide

When you use our Services you may provide content into that service (e.g. upload file, send a message).

#### Tracking & Cookies Data

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and hold certain information. We DO NOT track activity in your self-managed instances. We regularly monitor aggregated activity data on our infrastructure, but it is not tracking of individual users in the sense of this paragraph, which only occurs when we have a legitimate interest to do so (e.g. for security and compliance purposes). We do perform regular tracking on our community server.

Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device. Tracking technologies also used are beacons, tags, and scripts to collect and track information and to improve and analyze our Service.

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.

Examples of Cookies we use:

* Session Cookies. We use Session Cookies to operate our Service.
* Preference Cookies. We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings.
* Security Cookies. We use Security Cookies for security purposes.

### Distinction of data collection between Self Managed Workspaces and Hosted Workspaces

The following paragraph applies to data processing in Rocket.Chat workspaces and is for clarification purposes only. Self Managed workspaces and workspaces hosted by us differ in the kind of data we are processing from you because, in the case of our hosted offering, all data put into the workspaces is technically processed on our infrastructure.

There is also a difference between **registered**, self-managed workspaces (which consume services from us) and **unregistered**, self-managed workspaces.

See the following table for a general distinction between the data that is processed in each case. Keep in mind that this can differ in individual circumstances, such as cases where apps are installed on unregistered workspaces via workarounds.

|         Data type        | Self Managed (not registered) |                                                        Self Managed (registered)                                                        |                                                                Hosted                                                                |

|     **User content**     |               no              |  no - content is not processed, unless it falls under the aforementioned (e.g. the content of a push notification sent via our gateway) |   yes - as part of using the hosted workspace on our infrastructure.
