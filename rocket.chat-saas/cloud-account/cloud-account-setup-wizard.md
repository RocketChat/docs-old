Connecting your workplace to the cloud gives you access to interact with services like

* Live Chat Omnichannel proxy
* OAuth proxy for social network
* Apps Marketplace
{% endhint %}

![Server Registration](<../../.gitbook/assets/register server.png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
To register your server, we need to connect it to your cloud account. If you already have one- we will like it automatically. Otherwise, you need to create a [new account](https://docs.rocket.chat/rocket.chat-saas/cloud-account/create-new-cloud-account).
