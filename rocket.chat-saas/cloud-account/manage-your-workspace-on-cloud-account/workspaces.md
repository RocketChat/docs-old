## Restart Workspace

A restart of the server is recommended when facing small performance issues, e.g., messages are slow, messages are greyed-out.

To restart your workspace:

After you restart your workspace, it will take 1-5 minutes \(depending upon your number of users\) for the workspace to be restarted.

## Cancel Workspace

{% hint style="info" %}
Only cloud customers can cancel their workspaces. Self-managed customers can not do that.
{% endhint %}

If you want to stop using the SaaS service, you can go ahead and cancel it, as shown below:

Reload and the Status shows it's '**canceling'**. The status should remain '**canceling'** until the end of your billing cycle. After the billing cycle is ended the status should change to '**canceled'**, as shown below:
