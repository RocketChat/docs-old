# Cancel Workspace

You can cancel your workspace if you wish to end your subscription and hibernate your server (your server will still exist if you want to get back to Rocket.Chat later).

### **Cancel your workspace**

If you want to end your subscription, please note that it can be done only by the workspace administrator in your Cloud Console ([cloud.rocket.chat](https://cloud.rocket.chat/))

* Choose **workspace,** click on the three dots at the end of the correspondent workspace line and click **Cancel**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only cloud customers can cancel their workspaces. Self-managed customers cannot do that.
{% endhint %}

If you want to stop using the SaaS service, you can go ahead and cancel it, as shown below:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (198).png>)

Reload, and the status shows it's '**canceling';**

{% hint style="info" %}
The status should remain '**canceling'** until the end of your billing cycle.
{% endhint %}

After the billing cycle is ended, the status should change to '**canceled';** as shown below:

![](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (200).png>)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you change your mind within 30 days of your workspace getting canceled, please reach out to us at [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat) to get your workspace revived. After 30 days, you will have to create a new one.
{% endhint %}

### Post-factum Billing

Suppose you are an old customer; you might still be on the old pricing model where you are charged at the end of the month on which your billing period **** has ended, as shown below:

![Invoices](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/image (308) (2) (2) (1) (1) (2) (1) (2) (3).png>)

### Pre-paid Billing

If you are a new customer, you should be on the new pricing model and are charged in advance.
