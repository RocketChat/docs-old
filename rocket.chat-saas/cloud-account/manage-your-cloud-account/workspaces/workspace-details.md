### **To view workspace Information:**

If you click on a workspace, you can check the following information: workspace plan, push notification limit, total usage, and push notification usage,&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
* After your first sign-up, you are given a Rocket.Chat Enterprise Edition for 30 days. No payment is required. On the 30th day, you will be charged according to your chosen plan.
* The minimum volume or resources on Cloud provided per workspace is for 25 members, so you will be billed accordingly even if you have less than 25 users.
