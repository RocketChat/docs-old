# Payment Methods

You can add your credit or debit card as a new payment method for your Rocket.Chat account.  The payment methods will then list as an option when you make the payments. You have an option to set a card as your default payment method.

### **Add a new payment method:**

* Click **Payment Methods > Add Payment Method.**

![Add Payment Method](<../../../.gitbook/assets/payment methods.png>)

**Delete a card:**

If you have only one credit card added, it is impossible for you to delete the only payment method on your own. Please contact [support@rocket.chat](mailto:support@rocket.chat) to get it deleted.
