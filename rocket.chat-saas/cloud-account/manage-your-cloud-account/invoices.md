### Post-factum Billing

Please note that Rocket.Chat offers two pricing models. If you are an old customer, you might still be on the old pricing model where you need to make the payment at the end of the month your billing period has ended.

### Advance Billing

If you are a new customer, you should be on the new pricing model and make the payment in advance.
