# How can I help

There are multiple ways you can help - even if you don't write code,
you can still contribute.
We are always looking for assistance with creating or updating documentation,
testing our web, desktop and mobile apps, and reporting bugs.

**Developers** who wish to make contributions,
please go [here](/1.%20Contributing/Developing/) to start.

If you have found a **security issue**,
[report it](/1.%20Contributing/Security/).

Rocket.Chat is currently **translated** into more than twenty languages,
but we've got a long way to go.
If you'd like to assist us with this please email our
[translation team](mailto:translations@rocket.chat) to be invited to our [Lingohub](https://translate.lingohub.com) project.

To help improve our **documentation**, please visit [Rocket.Chat.Docs](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs).
To preview changes locally use [the generator](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs.Generator).

**Bloggers and news writers**, feel free to [spread the word](/1.%20Contributing/Promoting/)!
