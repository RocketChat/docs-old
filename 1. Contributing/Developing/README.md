## Getting Started

We will add an [In Progress label](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/stat%3A%20in%20progress), and that's it! Want a simple task to get you started? [We maintain a list of those](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/labels/contrib%3A%20easy)! Looking for other developer guides? [We have it here in the documentation](/6.%20Developer%20Guides/)!
