# Have a Workspace

If you have a Rocket.Chat workspace up and running you will need to verify if it is currently linked to a Cloud account. See the [following steps](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/connectivity-services.md) to do so.\


If you do not have a workspace yet, see this [guide ](does-not-have-a-workspace.md)on how to proceed.



After connecting to the Cloud account, go to [Rocket.Chat Cloud Portal](https://cloud.rocket.chat/home) **Workspaces** section where all your connected instances are listed

* Click on **Apply Trial** to continue

## Verify Active Workspace

* When all this is done, refresh the page, and you're able to see your workspace listed with current plan as **Enterprise** with an **Active** status.
